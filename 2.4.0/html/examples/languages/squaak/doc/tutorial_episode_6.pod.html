<h1><a name="Episode_6:_Scope_and_Subroutines"
>Episode 6: Scope and Subroutines</a></h1>

<p>In Episode 5,
we looked at variable declarations and implementing scope.
We covered a lot of information then,
but did not tell the full story,
in order to keep that post short.
In this episode we&#39;ll address the missing parts,
which will also result in implementing subroutines.</p>

<h2><a name="Variables"
>Variables</a></h2>

<p>In the previous episode,
we entered local variables into the current block&#39;s symbol table.
As we&#39;ve seen earlier,
using the do&#45;block statement,
scopes may nest.
Consider this example:</p>

<pre> do
     var x = 42
     do
         print(x)
     end
 end</pre>

<p>In this example, the print statement should print 42, even though x was not declared in the scope where it is referenced. How does the compiler know it&#39;s still a local variable? That&#39;s simple: it should look in all scopes, starting at the innermost scope. Only when the variable is found in any scope, should its scope be set to &#34;lexical&#34;, so that the right instructions are being generated.</p>

<p>The solution I came up with is shown below. Please note that I&#39;m not 100% sure if this is the &#34;best&#34; solution, but my personal understanding of the PAST compiler is limited. So, while this solution works, I may teach you the wrong &#34;habit&#34;. Please be aware of this.</p>

<pre> method identifier($/) {
     our @?BLOCK;
     my $name  := ~$&#60;ident&#62;;
     my $scope := &#39;package&#39;; # default value
     # go through all scopes and check if the symbol
     # is registered as a local. If so, set scope to
     # local.
     for @?BLOCK {
         if $_.symbol($name) {
             $scope := &#39;lexical&#39;;
         }
     }

     make PAST::Var.new( :name($name),
                         :scope($scope),
                         :viviself(&#39;Undef&#39;),
                         :node($/) );
 }</pre>

<h2><a name="Viviself"
>Viviself</a></h2>

<p>You might have noticed the viviself attribute before. This attribute will result in extra instructions that will initialize the variable if it doesn&#39;t exist. As you know, global variables spring into life automatically when they&#39;re used. Earlier we mentioned that uninitialized variables have a default value of &#34;Undef&#34;: the viviself attribute does this. For local variables, we use this mechanism to set the (optional) initialization value. When the identifier is a parameter, the parameter will be initialized automatically if it doesn&#39;t receive a value when the subroutine it belongs to is invoked. Effectively this means that all parameters in Squaak are optional!</p>

<h2><a name="Subroutines"
>Subroutines</a></h2>

<p>We already mentioned subroutines before, and introduced the <code>PAST::Block</code> node type. We also briefly mentioned the blocktype attribute that can be set on a <code>PAST::Block</code> node, which indicates whether the block is to be executed immediately (for instance, a do&#45;block or if statement) or it represents a declaration (for instance, subroutines). Let us now look at the grammar rule for subroutine definitions:</p>

<pre> rule sub_definition {
     &#39;sub&#39; &#60;identifier&#62; &#60;parameters&#62;
     &#60;statement&#62;*
     &#39;end&#39;
     {*}
 }

 rule parameters {
     &#39;(&#39; [&#60;identifier&#62; [&#39;,&#39; &#60;identifier&#62;]* ]? &#39;)&#39;
     {*}
 }</pre>

<p>This is rather straightforward, and the action methods for these rules are quite simple, as you will see. First, however, let&#39;s have a look at the rule for sub definitions. Why is the sub body defined as &#60;statement&#62;* and not as a &#60;block&#62;? Surely, a subroutine defines a new scope, which was already covered by &#60;block&#62; Well, you&#39;re right in that. However, as we will see, by the time that a new <code>PAST::Block</code> node would be created, we are too late! The parameters would already have been parsed, and not entered into the block&#39;s symbol table. That&#39;s a problem, because parameters are most likely to be used in the subroutine&#39;s body, and as they are not registered as local variables (which they are), any usage of parameters would not be compiled down to the right instructions to fetch any parameters.</p>

<p>So, how do we solve this in an efficient way?</p>

<p>The solution is simple. The only place where parameters live, is in the subroutine&#39;s body, represented by a PAST::Block node. Why don&#39;t we create the <code>PAST::Block</code> node in the action method for the parameters rule. By doing so, the block is already in place and the parameters are registered as local symbols right in time. Let&#39;s look at the action methods.</p>

<pre> method parameters($/) {
     our $?BLOCK;
     our @?BLOCK;
     my $past := PAST::Block.new( :blocktype(&#39;declaration&#39;), :node($/) );

     # now add all parameters to this block
     for $&#60;identifier&#62; {
         my $param := $( $_ );
         $param.scope(&#39;parameter&#39;);
         $past.push($param);

         # register the parameter as a local symbol
         $past.symbol($param.name(), :scope(&#39;lexical&#39;));
     }

     # now put the block into place on the scope stack
     $?BLOCK := $past;
     @?BLOCK.unshift($past);

     make $past;
 }

 method sub_definition($/) {
     our $?BLOCK;
     our @?BLOCK;
     my $past := $( $&#60;parameters&#62; );
     my $name := $( $&#60;identifier&#62; );

     # set the sub&#39;s name
     $past.name( $name.name() );

     # add all statements to the sub&#39;s body
     for $&#60;statement&#62; {
         $past.push( $( $_ ) );
     }

     # and remove the block from the scope stack and restore the current block
     @?BLOCK.shift();
     $?BLOCK := @?BLOCK[0];
     make $past;
 }</pre>

<p>First, let&#39;s check out the parse action for parameters. First, a new <code>PAST::Block</code> node is created. Then, we iterate over the list of identifiers (which may be empty), each representing a parameter. After retrieving the result object for a parameter (which is just an identifier), we set its scope to &#34;parameter&#34;, and we add it to the block object. After that, we register the parameter as a symbol in the block object, specifying the scope as &#34;lexical&#34;. Parameters are just a special kind of local variables, and there&#39;s no difference in a parameter and a declared local variable in a subroutine, except that a parameter will usually be initialized with a value that is passed when the subroutine is invoked. After handling the parameters, we set the current block (referred to by our package variable <code>$?BLOCK</code>) to <code>PAST::Block</code> node we just created, and push it on the scope stack (referred to by our package variable <code>@?BLOCK</code>).</p>

<p>After the whole subroutine definition is parsed, the action method <code>sub_definition</code> is invoked. This will retrieve the result object for parameters, which is the <code>PAST::Block</code> node that will represent the sub. After retrieving the result object for the sub&#39;s name, we set the name on the block node, and add all statements to the block. After this, we pop off this block node of the scope stack (<code>@?BLOCK</code>), and restore the current block (<code>$?BLOCK</code>).</p>

<p>Pretty easy, huh?</p>

<h2><a name="Subroutine_invocation"
>Subroutine invocation</a></h2>

<p>Once you defined a subroutine, you&#39;ll want to invoke it. In the exercises of Episode 5, we already gave some tips on how to create the PAST nodes for a subroutine invocation. In this section, we&#39;ll give a complete description. First we&#39;ll introduce the grammar rules.</p>

<pre> rule sub_call {
     &#60;primary&#62; &#60;arguments&#62;
     {*}
 }</pre>

<p>Not only allows this to invoke subroutines by their name, you can also store the subroutines in an array or hash field, and invoke them from there. Let&#39;s take a look at the action method, which is really quite straightforward.</p>

<pre> method sub_call($/) {
     my $invocant := $( $&#60;primary&#62; );
     my $past     := $( $&#60;arguments&#62; );
     $past.unshift($invocant);
     make $past;
 }

 method arguments($/) {
     my $past := PAST::Op.new( :pasttype(&#39;call&#39;), :node($/) );
     for $&#60;expression&#62; {
         $past.push( $( $_ ) );
     }
     make $past;
 }</pre>

<p>The result object of the sub_call method should be a <code>PAST::Op</code> node (of type <code>call</code>), which contains a number of child nodes: the first one is the invocant object, and all remaining children are the arguments to that sub call.</p>

<p>In order to &#34;move&#34; the result objects of the arguments to the sub_call method, we create the <code>PAST::Op</code> node in the method arguments, which is then retrieved by sub_call. In sub_call, the invocant object is set as the first child (using unshift). This is all too easy, isn&#39;t it? :&#45;)</p>

<h2><a name="What&#39;s_Next?"
>What&#39;s Next?</a></h2>

<p>In this episode we finished the implementation of scope in Squaak, and implemented subroutines. Our language is coming along nicely! In the next episode, we&#39;ll explore how to implement operators and an operator precedence table for efficient expression parsing.</p>

<p>In the mean time, should you have any problems or questions, don&#39;t hesitate to leave a comment!</p>

<h2><a name="Exercises"
>Exercises</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>By now you should have a good idea on the implementation of scope in Squaak. We haven&#39;t implemented the for&#45;statement yet, as it needs proper scope handling to implement. Implement this. Check out episode 3 for the BNF rules that define the syntax of the for&#45;statement. When implementing it, you will run into the same issue as we did when implementing subroutines and parameters. Use the same trick for the implementation of the for&#45;statement.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Solution_to_the_exercise"
>Solution to the exercise</a></h2>

<p>Without further ado, the solution to the exercise in Episode 6:</p>

<p>By now you should have a good idea on the implementation of scope in Squaak. We haven&#39;t implemented the for&#45;statement yet, as it needs proper scope handling to implement. Implement this. Check out Episode 3 for the BNF rules that define the syntax of the for&#45;statement. When implementing it, you will run into the same issue as we did when implementing subroutines and parameters. Use the same trick for the implementation of the for&#45;statement.</p>

<p>First, let us look at the BNF of the for&#45;statement:</p>

<pre>    for&#45;statement ::= &#39;for&#39; for&#45;init &#39;,&#39; expression [step]
                      &#39;do&#39;
                      block
                      &#39;end&#39;

    step          ::= &#39;,&#39; expression

    for&#45;init      ::= &#39;var&#39; identifier &#39;=&#39; expression</pre>

<p>It&#39;s pretty easy to convert this to Perl 6 rules:</p>

<pre>    rule for_statement {
        &#39;for&#39; &#60;for_init&#62; &#39;,&#39; &#60;expression&#62; &#60;step&#62;?
        &#39;do&#39; &#60;statement&#62;* &#39;end&#39;
        {*}
    }

    rule step {
        &#39;,&#39; &#60;expression&#62;
        {*}
    }

    rule for_init {
        &#39;var&#39; &#60;identifier&#62; &#39;=&#39; &#60;expression&#62;
        {*}
    }</pre>

<p>Pretty easy huh? Let&#39;s take a look at the semantics. A for&#45;loop is just another way to write a while loop, but much easier in certain cases. This:</p>

<pre>    for var &#60;ident&#62; = &#60;expr1&#62;, &#60;expr2&#62;, &#60;expr3&#62; do
       &#60;statement&#62;*
    end</pre>

<p>corresponds to:</p>

<pre>    do
      var &#60;ident&#62; = &#60;expr1&#62;
      while &#60;ident&#62; &#60;= &#60;expr2&#62; do
         &#60;statement&#62;*
         &#60;ident&#62; = &#60;ident&#62; + &#60;expr3&#62;
      end
    end</pre>

<p>If &#60;expr3&#62; is absent, it defaults to the value <code>1</code>. Note that the step expression (expr3) should be positive; the loop condition contains a &#34;&#60;=&#34; operator. When you specify a negative step expression, the loop variable will only decrease in value, which will never make the loop condition false (unless it overflows, but that&#39;s a different issue; this might even raise an exception in Parrot; this I do not know). Allowing negative step expressions introduces more complexity, which I felt was not worth the trouble for this tutorial language.</p>

<p>Note that the loop variable &#60;ident&#62; is local to the for loop; this is expressed in the equivalent while loop by the surrounding do/end pair: a new do/end pair defines a new (nested) scope; after the <code>end</code> keyword, the loop variable is no longer visible.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s implement the action method for the for&#45;statement. As was mentioned in the exercise description, we&#39;re dealing with the same situation as with subroutine parameters. In this case, we&#39;re dealing with the loop variable, which is local to the for&#45;statement. Let&#39;s check out the rule for for_init:</p>

<pre>    method for_init($/) {
        our $?BLOCK;
        our @?BLOCK;

        ## create a new scope here, so that we can
        ## add the loop variable
        ## to this block here, which is convenient.
        $?BLOCK := PAST::Block.new( :blocktype(&#39;immediate&#39;),
                                    :node($/) );
        @?BLOCK.unshift($?BLOCK);

        my $iter := $( $&#60;identifier&#62; );
        ## set a flag that this identifier is being declared
        $iter.isdecl(1);
        $iter.scope(&#39;lexical&#39;);
        ## the identifier is initialized with this expression
        $iter.viviself( $( $&#60;expression&#62; ) );

        ## enter the loop variable into the symbol table.
        $?BLOCK.symbol($iter.name(), :scope(&#39;lexical&#39;));

        make $iter;
    }</pre>

<p>So, just as we created a new <code>PAST::Block</code> for the subroutine in the action method for parameters, we create a new <code>PAST::Block</code> for the for&#45;statement in the action method that defines the loop variable. (Guess why we made for&#45;init a subrule, and didn&#39;t put in &#34;<code>var</code> &#60;ident&#38;gt = &#60;expression&#62;&#34; in the rule of for&#45;statement). This block is the place to live for the loop variable. The loop variable is declared, initialized using the viviself attribute, and entered into the new block&#39;s symbol table. Note that after creating the new <code>PAST::Block</code> object, we put it onto the stack scope.</p>

<p>Now, the action method for the for statement is quite long, so I&#39;ll just embed my comments, which makes reading it easier.</p>

<pre>    method for_statement($/) {
        our $?BLOCK;
        our @?BLOCK;</pre>

<p>First, get the result object of the for statement initialization rule; this is the <code>PAST::Var</code> object, representing the declaration and initialization of the loop variable.</p>

<pre>        my $init := $( $&#60;for_init&#62; );</pre>

<p>Then, create a new node for the loop variable. Yes, another one (besides the one that is currently contained in the <code>PAST::Block</code>). This one is used when the loop variable is updated at the end of the code block (each iteration). The difference with the other one, is that it doesn&#39;t have the <code>isdecl</code> flag, and it doesn&#39;t have a <code>viviself</code> clause, which would result in extra instructions checking whether the variable is null (and we know it&#39;s not, because we initialize the loop variable).</p>

<pre>        ## cache the name of the loop variable
        my $itername := $init.name();
        my $iter := PAST::Var.new( :name($itername),
                               :scope(&#39;lexical&#39;),
                               :node($/) );</pre>

<p>Now, retrieve the <code>PAST::Block</code> node from the scope stack, and push all statement PAST nodes onto it.</p>

<pre>        ## the body of the loop consists of the statements written by the user and
        ## the increment instruction of the loop iterator.

        my $body := @?BLOCK.shift();
        $?BLOCK  := @?BLOCK[0];
        for $&#60;statement&#62; {
            $body.push($($_));
        }</pre>

<p>If there was a step, we use that value; otherwise, we use assume a default step size of <code>1</code>. Negative step sizes won&#39;t work, but if you Feel Lucky, you could go ahead and try. It&#39;s not that hard, it&#39;s just a lot of work, and I&#39;m too lazy for that now.... ehm, I mean, I leave it as the proverbial exercise to the reader.</p>

<pre>        my $step;
        if $&#60;step&#62; {
            my $stepsize := $( $&#60;step&#62;[0] );
            $step := PAST::Op.new( $iter, $stepsize, :pirop(&#39;add&#39;), :node($/) );
        }
        else { ## default is increment by 1
            $step := PAST::Op.new( $iter, :pirop(&#39;inc&#39;), :node($/) );
        }</pre>

<p>The incrementing of the loop variable is part of the loop body, so add the incrementing statement to $body.</p>

<pre>        $body.push($step);</pre>

<p>The loop condition uses the &#34;&#60;=&#34; operator, and compares the loop variable with the maximum value that was specified.</p>

<pre>        ## while loop iterator &#60;= end&#45;expression
        my $cond := PAST::Op.new( $iter,
                                  $( $&#60;expression&#62; ),
                                  :name(&#39;infix:&#60;=&#39;) );</pre>

<p>Now we have the PAST for the loop condition and the loop body, so now create a PAST to represent the (while) loop.</p>

<pre>        my $loop := PAST::Op.new( $cond, $body, :pasttype(&#39;while&#39;), :node($/) );</pre>

<p>Finally, the initialization of the loop variable should go before the loop itself, so create a <code>PAST::Stmts</code> node to do this:</p>

<pre>        make PAST::Stmts.new( $init, $loop, :node($/) );
    }</pre>

<p>Wow, we&#39;ve done it! This was a good example of how to implement a non&#45;trivial statement type using PAST.</p>
