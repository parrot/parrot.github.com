<p>docs/dev/pmc_freeze.pod &#45; Freeze/Thaw Design Notes</p>

<h1><a name="VERSION"
>VERSION</a></h1>

<p>This document describes freeze/thaw internals version 0.1.
This is not the final implementation.</p>

<h1><a name="Overview"
>Overview</a></h1>

<p>Freezing or serializing arbitrary PMCs is an interesting problem.
Aggregates can hold other aggregates and can be deeply nested,
so so a recursive approach could easily blow the stack,
especially on embedded systems.
Also,
aggregates can be self&#45;referential &#45;&#45; they can hold pointers to themselves &#45;&#45; so that working on such structures could create infinite loops.</p>

<h1><a name="Coverage"
>Coverage</a></h1>

<p>Although the file is named <em>pmc_freeze.c</em> it ultimately will deal with every kind of operation that deeply traverses an arbitrary data structures.
For example:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="freeze"
>freeze</a></dt>
Called from user code to serialize the state of a PMC into some (possibly binary) representation held in a STRING.
<dt><a name="freeze_at_destruct"
>freeze_at_destruct</a></dt>
A variant of <code>freeze</code>,
possibly called from an exception handler or on resource shortage before interpreter shutdown,
to save some data before dying.
It must not consume any additional resources.
<dt><a name="thaw"
>thaw</a></dt>
The opposite of <code>freeze</code>: reconstruct all PMCs to generate an identical copy of the original frozen PMC.
As with <code>freeze</code>,
can be called from user code.
<dt><a name="dclone"
>dclone</a></dt>
Deeply clone an aggregate.
<code>dclone(p)</code> is basically the same as <code>thaw(freeze(p))</code>.
<dt><a name="dump,_pretty_print"
>dump,
pretty_print</a></dt>
Create a visual representation of an aggregate.
<dt><a name="destruction_ordering"
>destruction ordering</a></dt>
Find the logical dependencies of a collection of PMCs,
so that they can be destroyed in an appropriate order.
This is also called on interpreter shutdown.
<dt><a name="mark"
>mark</a></dt>
Mark all objects as being live by calling <b>Parrot_gc_mark_PObj_alive</b> called from GC.
While the functionality is the same,
it will not be implemented on top of this general scheme for performance reasons.
This leads to some code duplication,
but GC is run permanently and deserves all the speed it can get.</dl>

<h1><a name="Description"
>Description</a></h1>

<p>The basic scheme of operation looks like this:</p>

<pre>  info = init()
  push todo_list, pmc
  while (todo_list)
      current = shift todo_list
      current&#45;&#62;visit(info)
  done.</pre>

<h2><a name="The_visit_info_structure"
>The visit_info structure</a></h2>

<p>This structure holds all necessary information and function pointers specific to the desired functionality. It gets passed on to all vtable functions and callback functions.</p>

<h2><a name="Working_loop"
>Working loop</a></h2>

<dl>
<dt><a name="todo_list"
>todo list</a></dt>
A <b>List</b> called <b>todo</b> holds items still to be worked on. This method is slower and consumes more resources, but doesn&#39;t interfere with GC runs and is thread&#45;safe.</dl>

<h2><a name="Putting_items_on_the_todo_list"
>Putting items on the todo list</a></h2>

<p>This is done by a callback function inside the <b>visit_info</b> structure called <b>visit_pmc_now</b>. It gets called initially to put the first item on the list and is called thereafter from all PMCs for contained PMCs inside the <b>visit</b> vtable function.</p>

<h2><a name="The_visit()_vtable"
>The visit() vtable</a></h2>

<p>The general scheme above shows that this method is called for all items on the <b>todo_list</b>. <b>visit</b> has to call <b>visit_pmc_now</b> for all contained PMCs, which then get visited until all is done.</p>

<h2><a name="The_visit_pmc_now()_callback"
>The visit_pmc_now() callback</a></h2>

<p>The basic operation is:</p>

<pre>  (seen, id) = was_already_seen(pmc)
  do_specific_action(pmc, seen, id)
  if (!seen)
     pmc&#45;&#62;visit_action()</pre>

<h2><a name="Avoiding_duplicates"
>Avoiding duplicates</a></h2>

<p>As stated in the introduction structures can be self&#45;referential, they can contain (at an arbitrary depth) PMCs, that were already processed. Just following these PMCs would lead to endless loops. So already <b>seen</b> PMCs have to be remembered.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="The_seen_hash"
>The <b>seen</b> hash</a></dt>
Using a <b>Hash</b> is one method to avoid duplicates. The <b>seen</b> hash holds keys being the address of the PMC and values being a PMC <b>id</b>, which is unique for this PMC. While this is straight forward, it consumes 16 bytes per PMC (plus overhead, 32&#45;bit system assumed). Hash lookups also take a considerable amount of time.</dl>

<h2><a name="The_actual_action"
>The actual action</a></h2>

<p>So after all we finally arrived at the point to actually perform the desired functionality. First the PMC&#45;specific part is done inside <em>pmc_freeze.c</em> then the specific vtable function <b>freeze</b>, <b>thaw</b>, whatever, is called, again via a function pointer called <b>visit_action</b>.</p>

<h1><a name="Freeze_and_thaw"
>Freeze and thaw</a></h1>

<p>As stated PMCs are currently processed inside the core, PMC&#45;specific parts are done by calling the PMCs vtable function. This parts could of course be moved to <em>default.pmc</em> too, so that it&#39;s simpler to override the functionality.</p>

<h2><a name="Serializer_interface"
>Serializer interface</a></h2>

<p>During initialization the <b>visit_info</b>s <b>image_io</b> data pointer is filled with an object having <b>vtable</b> functions that remarkably look like a PMCs vtable. So <b>io&#45;&#62;vtable&#45;&#62;push_integer</b> spits out an INTVAL to the frozen <b>image</b>, while <b>shift_integer</b> gets an INTVAL from the frozen stream.</p>

<p>This simplifies final changes when <b>image_io</b> becomes just a PMC of some serializer class. There are currently two serializers:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="Plain_text"
>Plain text</a></dt>
This serializer is mainly intended for testing. Having a readable representation of the image simplifies debugging a lot.
<dt><a name="Parrot_Byte_Code"
>Parrot Byte Code</a></dt>
We already have a platform&#45;independent way of reading and writing opcodes, string, and number&#45;constants. So this serializer uses functionality of the pack&#45;file routines. The produced image isn&#39;t as dense as it could be though, because all data are aligned at <b>opcode_t</b> boundaries.</dl>

<h2><a name="Image_data_format"
>Image data format</a></h2>

<p>PMC <b>id</b>s ranging from 1 to N&#45;PMCs are shifted left by two, so that the 2 lo bits can serve as flags:</p>

<pre>  id + 0x1   ... PMC was seen
  id + 0x2   ... PMC has same type as previous PMC
  id + 0x3   ... escape flag</pre>

<p>A PMCs image generally looks like:</p>

<pre>  &#60;id&#62;&#60;type&#62;&#60;pmc&#45;specific&#45;data&#62;</pre>

<p>The text representation of the array</p>

<pre>  P0 = [P1=666, P2=777, P0]</pre>

<p>may look like:</p>

<pre>  0xdf4 30 3 0xdf8 33 666 0xdf2 777 0xdf5

  0xdf4 ... PMC id (with &#34;0x&#34; in front for clarity)
  30    ... enum_class_ResizablePMCArray
  3     ... elements count
  0xdf8 ... id of first element
  33    ... enum_class_Integer
  666   ... value
  0xdf2 ... id of second element, same type as prev element
  777   ... value
  0xdf5 ... id of array itself with lo bit set</pre>

<p>The escape flag marks places in the image, where additional data will follow. After the escape flag is an int defining the kind of the following data, passed on in <b>extra_flags</b>. During <b>thaw</b> the PMCs vtable is called again, to restore these data. So a PMCs <b>thaw</b> vtable has to check <b>extra_flags</b> if normal or extra data have to be shifted from the image.</p>

<p>This is e.g. needed for PMC properties or arrays containing sparse holes, to set the array index of the following data.</p>

<p>A Integer(666) with a property hash (&#34;answer&#34;=&#62;42) thus looks like:</p>

<pre>  0xdfc 33 666 0xdff 2 0xdf4 32 1 answer 0xdf8 33 42</pre>

<p><b>0xdff</b> is the escape mark for the PMC <b>0xdfc</b> followed by the constant <b>EXTRA_IS_PROP_HASH</b>.</p>

<p>[ To be continued ]</p>
