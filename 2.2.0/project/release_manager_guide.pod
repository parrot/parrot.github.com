=head1 Release Instructions

To prepare a release:

=over 4

=item 0.

As soon as you become the release manager: review the goals for the release on
the Parrot roadmap (L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/roadmap>) and
announce the tasks to the Parrot mailing list.  Make sure everyone knows what
they've committed to accomplish in time for the release.

Right after the release preceeding your release, it is a good idea to start
tracking parrot news in NEWS. A good resource are the reports
in the weekly #parrotsketch IRC-meeting. A reliable log of these meetings
is available in L<http://irclog.perlgeek.de/parrotsketch/>.

A couple of weeks in advance: Ask people to run C<make fulltest> and
report (and hopefully fix!) any problems they find. Check in with
language project leads for release blockers, to allow time to fix them.
Also ask people to review the tickets targeted for the upcoming release
L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/roadmap>.

Make sure your ssh key have been added to the FTP server ftp-osl.osuosl.org.
Without the key you won't be able to ship the release.

Set up your account on L<http://www.parrot.org/> and ask an previous release
manager to provide you with editor privileges if you don't already have them.
Any previous release manager should be able to help.

A couple of days in advance: announce the new release to
parrot-dev@lists.parrot.org and to the IRC channel #parrot. Ask whether
there are any showstopping bugs. Check in again with the language
project leads. It's also good to ask for updates to F<NEWS>, F<CREDITS>,
F<PLATFORMS>, F<RESPONSIBLE_PARTIES>, F<DEPRECATED.pod> and
L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/Languages>.

On the Saturday before a release you should notify other developers to stop
committing non-release related code to trunk.  This will help avoid
complications. They are of course free to commit to branches as much as
they like. You might also set the topic in #parrot, announcing the
time when you plan on starting the release procedure. This will help
the committers with timing their last minute commits.

You might also select a name (and optionally a quote) for your release.
For example, you could select a name from
L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parrots>.

=item 1.

The day of the release has come.
Make sure you're up to date:

 $ svn update

=item 2.

Update files with version-specific information:

=over 4

=item a

Increment the version number in the following files:
F<VERSION>, F<MANIFEST.generated>, F<META.yml>, F<README>.

Also update the version number, date, and your name in the
the file: F<docs/parrothist.pod>.

Update this file, that is F<release_manager_guide.pod>,
to remove the pending release you're in the middle of.

=item b

Update F<ChangeLog>, F<NEWS> with the new version number and any other
changes that have occurred since the last release: Hopefully these files
are being updated as committers work. If not, it's probably a good idea
to gather the updates weekly rather than waiting until the day of the
monthly release.

=item c

Update release-related information in F<tools/util/release.json>. This will be
used later when making release announcements.  There are a few essential
fields that must be updated at each release:

=over 4

=item C<release.*>

The date of the next release is in L<Appendix 1|"Appendix 1 - Upcoming releases">.

=item C<bugday.date>

Enter the date of the Saturday before the next release.

=item C<wiki.bugday>

Update the date part of the link to the wiki page for the next bugday.

=item C<ftp.path>

The URL of the FTP directory where the Parrot tarball can be found.

=back

=item d

Make sure F<RESPONSIBLE_PARTIES> is still accurate.

=item e

Give yourself credit for the release in F<CREDITS>.

=item f

Configure parrot and run C<make distro_tests>, and either fix
what those tests complain about, or fix them so they don't complain.

=item g

If this is a developer release, or there have been no new entries to the
F<PBC_COMPAT> file, skip this step.

If this is a supported release, and new entries to F<PBC_COMPAT> have been
added since the last supported release, make a new entry with a new major
version number for this release at the top of the list.

  3.0     2007.10.17      coke    released 0.4.17

Delete all minor version numbers since the last major bytecode version number,
as these are only used in development and not relevant to the bytecode support
policy. (Those changes are all included within the major version number
increase for the supported release.)

Once you've updated PBC_COMPAT, run C<sh tools/dev/mk_native_pbc> to update the
pbc files used in the native pbc tests.  Note that you must have Parrot already
built for this to work, and that this script will reconfigure and rebuild
Parrot with various primitive size options.

=item h

Make sure everything works:

 $ make realclean
 $ perl Configure.pl --test ...
 $ make world docs html 2>&1 | tee make_world_docs_html.log
 $ make fulltest        2>&1 | tee make_fulltest.log

Note that running "make fulltest" takes a while and that separate
harnesses are being run.

=back

=item 3.

When all is well, then commit your changes:

 svn diff | more
 svn commit

Write down the revision number from this commit. You will need it later in
step 7.

=item 4.

Prepare the release tarball.

 $ make release VERSION=a.b.c

where a.b.c is the version number. This will create the tarball named
F<parrot-a.b.c.tar.gz>. This will automatically avoid including C<DEVELOPING>
in the release tarball.

=item 5.

Untar F<parrot-a.b.c.tar.gz> into another area.

=item 6.

Make sure everything works:

 $ perl Configure.pl
 $ make world docs html 2>&1 | tee make_world_docs_html.log
 $ make fulltest        2>&1 | tee make_fulltest.log

Verify that the version is correct and doesn't contain the suffix C<devel>:

 $ ./parrot -V

=item 7.

Tag the release as "RELEASE_a_b_c", where a.b.c is the version number.
Specify the revision number generated in step 3, above.

 $ export SVNPARROT=https://svn.parrot.org/parrot
 $ svn copy -r <REV> -m "tagged release a.b.c" \
   $SVNPARROT/trunk $SVNPARROT/tags/RELEASE_a_b_c

=item 8.

SSH to ftp-osl.osuosl.org. (If you don't have the necessary login information,
get it from one of the previous release managers.)

 $ ssh -l <USERNAME> ftp-osl.osuosl.org

If the release is a monthly development release, create a new directory under
F<~/ftp/releases/devel>.

 $ mkdir ~/ftp/releases/devel/a.b.c

If the release is in the stable series (L<Appendix 1 - Upcoming releases>)
create the new directory in F<~/ftp/releases/stable> instead.

 $ mkdir ~/ftp/releases/stable/a.b.c

Copy the tarball from your machine into the new directory.

 $ scp parrot-a.b.c.tar.gz <USERNAME>@ftp-osl.osuosl.org:~/ftp/releases/devel/a.b.c/.

(Or using C<wget> or whatever tool you prefer.)

When you're finished making changes, run the trigger script to push the changes
out to the FTP mirrors.

  ~/trigger-parrot

Check your changes at F<ftp://ftp.parrot.org/pub/parrot/releases>. It should
only take a few minutes for the mirrors to sync.

=item 9.

Compose the release announcement.  Use F<tools/util/crow.pir> to make
this part easier.  You can specify the format of your announcements like so:

  $ ./parrot tools/util/crow.pir --type=text
  $ ./parrot tools/util/crow.pir --type=html

Take the screen output and paste it into the application you need.  HTML
works well for use Perl and PerlMonks, and text for the rest.  It is not a
bad idea to add a "highlights" section to draw attention to major new
features, just be sure to say the same thing in both text and HTML versions.

=item 10.

Update the website. You will need an account with editor rights
on L<http://www.parrot.org>.

=over 4

=item a

Add a new page for the release announcement with "Create content" -> "Story".
There's some additional stuff needed at the top of the page; use one of the
old announcements as a guide.

The "<!--break-->" line marks the end of the text that will appear on the
front page.

=item b

For the "News" category, select both "Releases" and "News".

Add tags to the page for significant changes in this release (e.g. "rakudo" for
significant Rakudo language updates, or "gc" for significant garbage collection
subsystem updates).

=item c

Under "URL path settings" uncheck "Automatic alias" and set the path to
news/[year]/Parrot-[release number].

=item d

Under "Publishing options" make sure "Published" and "Promoted to front page"
are checked.

=item e

Under "Administer" -> "Site building" -> "URL Redirects", change the URL for
"release/current" to the FTP directory for the new release (for example,
F<ftp://ftp.parrot.org/pub/parrot/releases/devel/0.8.1>). Also update
the URL for "release/developer" or "release/supported" depending on
which type of release this is.

=item f

Update docs.parrot.org. Run "make html" in a release copy of parrot, and save
the resources/ and html/ directories created in docs/.
ssh into the parrotvm, and in the
webroot for docs.parrot.org, expand these into a release directory (e.g.
1.4.0). in <webroot>/parrot, there are symbolic links for latest, stable,
and devel. Update the latest symlink to point to your new directory.
If this is a stable release, also update the stable symlink. Do not delete
any old copies of the docs.

=back

Preview the new page, and submit it.

(The old release announcement may be edited to uncheck "Promoted to front page"
to keep the main page fresh.)

=item 11.

Publicize the release by publishing the announcement through the
following channels (and any others you can think of):

=over 4

=item a

Send a text email to parrot-dev, parrot-users, perl6-language, perl6-announce,
perl5-porters, etc.  You should also include LWN.net in this mailing; email to
C<lwn> at that domain.

=item b

Submit the use Perl announcement story to use Perl, Perl Monks, Slashdot,
Newsforge, etc.  Don't forget to set a Reply-To: or Followup-To: header, if
your mail client lets you.

=item c

Modify the topic on #parrot, e.g.:

 /topic #parrot Parrot 0.4.8 Released | http://parrot.org/

=item d

Update the wiki frontpage at L<http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/>.

=item e

Update the Wikipedia entry at L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot_virtual_machine>.

=item f

Update the C2 wiki entry at L<http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ParrotCode>.

=back

=item 12.

Review the milestone for the current release in Trac at
L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/roadmap>. Close any completed
release-related tickets. Edit the milestone to mark it as "Completed".
Marking a milestone as completed will migrate all open tickets to a
selected milestone (generally the next milestone). Non-critical tickets
can have their milestone unset.

=item 13.

Add the version to Trac so new bug reports can be filed against your
buggy code. L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/admin/ticket/versions>.

Make the latest released version the default version for new reports.

Remove any sufficiently old versions listed there.

=item 14.

You're done! Help yourself to a beer, cola, or other celebratory drink.

=back

=head2 ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT

This document was written after a couple of subtly incorrectly assembled
releases--usually when someone forgot to delete F<DEVELOPING> (which is now
automated!), but at least once where the F<MANIFEST> check failed. The intent
of this file is to document what must be done to release so that such mistakes
won't happen again.

=head1 SEE ALSO

F<README>, F<RESPONSIBLE_PARTIES>.

=head1 Appendix 1 - Upcoming releases

To make a monthly release schedule possible, we spread the burden of
releases across multiple release managers. Releases are scheduled for
the 3rd Tuesday of each month.

The starred releases are Parrot's quarterly supported releases, see
F<docs/project/support_policy.pod>.

The calendar of releases is available at the comp.lang.parrot google calendar,
visible at
L<http://www.google.com/calendar/render?cid=ldhctdamsgfg5a1cord52po9h8@group.calendar.google.com>.
