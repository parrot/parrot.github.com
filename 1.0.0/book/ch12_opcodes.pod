=head1 Opcodes

Z<CHP-12>

The smallest executable component is not the compilation unit or even the
subroutine, but is actually the opcode. Opcodes in Parrot, like opcodes in
other machines (both virtual and physical), are individual instructions that
implement low-level operations in the machine. In the world of
microprocessors, the word "opcode" typically refers to the numeric identifier
for each instructions. The human-readable word used in the associated assembly
language is called the "mnemonic". An assembler, among other tasks, is
responsible for converting mnemonics into opcodes for execution. In Parrot,
instead of referring to an instruction by different names depending on what
form it's in, we just call them all "opcodes". Of course the list of things
that qualify as "low-level" in Parrot can be pretty advanced compared to the
functionality supplied by regular assembly language opcodes.

=head2 Opcodes

Opcodes are the smallest logical execution element in Parrot. An
individual opcode corresponds, in an abstract kind of way, with a single
machine code instruction for a particular hardware processor
architecture. The difference is that Parrot's opcodes can perform some
very complex and high-level tasks that each may take many execution cycles
for the average hardware processor. Also, Parrot's opcodes can be
dynamically loaded in from a special library file called a I<dynop
library>. We'll talk about dynops a little bit later.

=head3 Opcode naming

To the PIR and PASM programmers, opcodes appear to be polymorphic. That
is, some opcodes appear to have multiple argument formats. This is just an
illusion, however. Parrot opcodes are not polymorphic, although certain
features enable it to appear that way. Different argument list formats
are detected during parsing and translated into separate, and unique,
opcode names. 

=head3 Opcode Multiple Dispatch

=head2 Writing Opcodes

Writing Opcodes, like writing PMCs, is done in a C-like language which is
later compiled into C code by the X<opcode compiler> opcode compiler. The
opcode script represents a thin overlay on top of ordinary C code: All
valid C code is valid opcode script. There are a few neat additions that
make writing opcodes easier. This script is very similar to that used to
define PMCs. The C<INTERP> constant, for instance, is always available
in the opcodes like they are in VTABLE and METHOD declarations. Unlike
VTABLEs and METHODs, opcodes are defined with the C<op> keyword.

Opcodes are written in files with the C<.ops> extension. The core
operation files are stored in the C<src/ops/> directory.

=head3 Opcode Parameters

Each opcode can take any fixed number of input and output arguments. These
arguments can be any of the four primary data types--INTVALs, PMCs, NUMBERS
and STRINGs--but can also be one of several other types of values including
LABELs, KEYs and INTKEYs.

Each parameter can be an input, an output or both, using the C<in>, C<out>,
and C<inout> keywords respectively. Here is an example:

  op Foo (out INT, in NUM)

This opcode could be called like this:

  $I0 = Foo $N0     # in PIR syntax
  Foo $I0, $N0      # in PASM syntax

When Parrot parses through the file and sees the C<Foo> operation, it
converts it to the real name C<Foo_i_n>. The real name of an opcode
is its name followed by an underscore-separated ordered list of
the parameters to that opcode. This is how Parrot appears to use
polymorphism: It translates the overloaded opcode common names into
longer unique names depending on the parameter list of that opcode. Here
is a list of some of the variants of the C<add> opcode:

  add_i_i      # $I0 += $I1
  add_n_n      # $N0 += $N1
  add_p_p      # $P0 += $P1
  add_i_i_i    # $I0 = $I1 + $I2
  add_p_p_i    # $P0 = $P1 + $I0
  add_p_p_n    # $P0 = $P1 + $N0

This isn't a complete list, but you should get the picture. Each different
combination of parameters translates to a different unique operation, and
each operation is remarkably simple to implement. In some cases, Parrot
can even use its multi-method dispatch system to call opcodes which are
heavily overloaded, or for which there is no exact fit but the parameters
could be coerced into different types to complete the operation. For
instance, attempting to add a STRING to a PMC might coerce the string into
a numerical type first, and then dispatch to the C<add_p_p_n> opcode. This
is just an example, and the exact mechanisms may change as more opcodes
are added or old ones are deleted.

Parameters can be one of the following types:

=over 4

=item * INT

=item * NUM

=item * STR

=item * PMC

=item * KEY

=item * INTKEY

=item * LABEL

=back

In addition to these types, you need to specify the direction that data is
moving through that parameter:

=over 4

=item * in

=item * out

=item * inout

=item * invar

=back

=head3 Opcode Control Flow

Some opcodes have the ability to alter control flow of the program they
are in. There are a number of control behaviors that can be implemented,
such as an unconditional jump in the C<goto> opcode, or a subroutine
call in the C<call> code, or the conditional behavior implemented by C<if>.

At the end of each opcode you can call a C<goto> operation to jump to the
next opcode to execute. If no C<goto> is performed, control flow will
continue like normal to the next operation in the program. In this way,
opcodes can easily manipulate control flow. Opcode script provides a
number of keywords to alter control flow:

=over 4

=item * NEXT()

If C<NEXT> contains the address of the next opcode in memory. You don't
need to call C<goto NEXT()>, however, because the default behavior for
all opcodes is to automatically jump to the next opcode in the program
N<You can do this if you really want to, but it really wouldn't help you
any>. The C<NEXT> keyword is frequently used in places like the C<invoke>
opcode to create a continuation to the next opcode to return to after
the subroutine returns.

=item * ADDRESS()

Jumps execution to the given address.

  ADDRESS(x);
  
Here, C<x> should be an C<opcode_t *> value of the opcode to jump to.

=item * OFFSET()

Jumps to the address given as an offset from the current address.

  OFFSET(x)

Here, C<x> is an offset in C<size_t> units that represents how far forward
(positive) or how far backwards (negative) to jump to.

=item * POP()

C<POP> pops the next opcode address off the control stack. To put an address
onto the control stack, use the C<PUSH> keyword instead. C<PUSH> takes a single
C<opcode_t *> argument to store, and C<POP> returns a single C<opcode_ *>
value.

=head2 The Opcode Compiler

As we've seen in our discussions above, ops have a number of transformations
to go through before they can be become C code and compiled into Parrot.
The various special variables like C<$1>, C<INTERP> and C<ADDRESS> need to be
converted to normal variable values. Also, each runcore requires the ops be
compiled into various formats: The slow and fast cores need the ops to be
compiled into individual subroutines. The switch core needs all the ops to be
compiled into a single function using a large C<switch> statement. The
computed goto cores require the ops be compiled into a large function with a
large array of label addresses.

Parrot's opcode compiler is a tool that's tasked with taking raw opcode files
with a C<.ops> extension and converting them into several different formats,
all of which need to be syntactically correct C code for compilation.

=head2 Dynops

Parrot has about 1200 built-in opcodes. These represent operations which are
sufficiently simple and fundamental, but at the same time are very common.
However, these do not represent all the possible operations that some
programmers are going to want to use. Of course, not all of those 1200 ops
are unique, many of them are overloaded variants of one another. As an example
there are about 36 variants of the C<set> opcode, to account for all the
different types of values you may want to set to all the various kinds of
registers. The number of unique operations therefore is much smaller then 1200.

This is where I<dynops> come in. Dynops are dynamically-loadable libraries of
ops that can be written and compiled separately from Parrot and loaded in at
runtime. dynops, along with dynpmcs and runtime libraries are some of the
primary ways that Parrot can be extended.

Parrot ships with a small number of example dynops libraries in the file
L<src/dynoplibs/>. These are small libraries of mostly nonsensical but
demonstrative opcodes that can be used as an example to follow.

Dynops can be writte in a C<.ops> file like the normal built-in ops are.
The ops file should use C<#include "parrot/extend.h"> in addition to any
other libraries the ops need. They can be compiled into C using the opcode
compiler, then compiled into a shared library using a normal C compiler. Once
compiled, the dynops can be loaded into Parrot using the .loadlib directive.
