=head1 NAME

docs/pdds/pdd19_pir.pod - Parrot Intermediate Representation

=head1 ABSTRACT

This document describes PIR, a stable, middle-level language for both
compiler and human to target on.

=head1 VERSION

$Revision$

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 Comments and empty lines

Comments start with B<#> and last until the following newline. These
and empty lines are ignored.

PIR allows POD blocks.

=head1 Statements

A valid PIR program consists of a sequence of I<statements>. A
I<statement> is terminated by a newline (<NL>). So, each statement has to be
on its own line.

=head2 General statement format

Any statement can start with a optional label and is terminated by a
newline:

  [label:] [instruction] <NL>

=head2 Labels

PIR code has both local and global labels. Global labels start with an
underscore, local labels shouldn't.  Optional label for the given
instruction, can stand on its own line. A label must conform to the syntax
of B<identifier> described below.

The name of a global label has to be unique, since it can be called at any
point in the program. A local label is accessible only in the compilation
unit where it's defined. A local label name must be unique within a
compilation unit, but it can be reused in other compilation units.

Examples:

  branch L1   # local label
  bsr    _L2  # global label

=head1 INSTRUCTIONS

=head2 Terms used here

=over 4

=item <identifier>

Identifiers start with a letter or underscore, then may contain additionally
letters, digits, underscores and B<::>. Identifiers don't have any limit on
length.

{{ REVIEW: identifier length limit }}

{{ REVIEW: can op-names be used as identifiers? See #24251. }}

Example:

    a
    _a
    A42
    a::b_c

=item <type>

Can be B<int>, B<float>, B<string> or B<pmc>.

{{ REFERENCE: RT#42769 }}

=item <reg>

A PASM register In, Sn, Nn, Pn, or a PIR temporary register $In, $Sn, $Nn,
$Pn, where B<n> consists of digit(s) only. B<n> must be between 1 and 99.

{{ REVIEW: n limit }}

=item <var>

A local B<identifier>, a B<reg> or a constant (when allowed). A constant
is not allowed on the left side of an assignment.

{{ REVIEW: any other places where constant is not allowed }}

=back

=head2 Constants

=over 4

=item 'char constant'

Are delimited by B<'>. They are taken to be C<ascii> encoded. No escape
sequences are processed.

=item "string constants"

Are delimited by B<">. A B<"> inside a string must be escaped by
B<\>.  Only 7-bit ASCII is accepted in string constants; to use
characters outside thar range, specify an encoding in the way below.

=item <<"heredoc",  <<'heredoc'

Heredocs work like single or double quoted strings. All lines up to
the terminating delimiter are slurped into the string. The delimiter
has to be on its own line, at the beginning of the line and with no 
trailing whitespace.

Assignment of a heredoc:

A heredoc as an argument:

  function(<<"END_OF_HERE", arg)
  ...
 END_OF_HERE

  .return(<<'EOS')
  ...
 EOS

  .yield(<<'EOS')
  ...
 EOS

Only one heredoc can be active per statement line.

{{ REVIEW: it would be useful to have multiple heredocs per statement,
   which allows for writing:

   function(<<'INPUT', <<'OUTPUT', 'some test')
   ...
 INPUT
   ...
 OUTPUT

}}

=item charset:"string constant"

Like above with a character set attached to the string. Valid character
sets are currently: C<ascii> (the default), C<binary>, C<unicode>
(with UTF-8 as the default encoding), and C<iso-8859-1>.

=back

=head2 String escape sequences

Inside double-quoted strings the following escape sequences are processed.

  \xhh        1..2 hex digits
  \ooo        1..3 oct digits
  \cX         control char X
  \x{h..h}    1..8 hex digits
  \uhhhh      4 hex digits
  \Uhhhhhhhh  8 hex digits
  \a, \b, \t, \n, \v, \f, \r, \e, \\

=over 4

=item encoding:charset:"string constant"

Like above with an extra encoding attached to the string. For example:

  set S0, utf8:unicode:"Â«"

The encoding and charset gets attached to the string, no further processing
is done, specifically escape sequences are not honored.

=item numeric constants

B<0x> and B<0b> denote hex and binary constants respectively.

=back

=head2 Directive instructions

=over 4

=item .pragma n_operators

Convert arithmethic infix operators to n_infix operations. The unary opcodes
C<abs>, C<not>, C<bnot>, C<bnots>, and C<neg> are also changed to use a B<n_>
prefix.

 .pragma n_operators 1
 .sub foo
   ...
   $P0 = $P1 + $P2           # n_add $P0, $P1, $P2
   $P2 = abs $P0             # n_abs $P2, $P0

=item .loadlib "lib_name"

Load the given library at B<compile time>, that is, as soon that line is
parsed.  See also the C<loadlib> opcode, which does the same at run time.

A library loaded this way is also available at runtime, as if it has been
loaded again in C<:load>, so there is no need to call C<loadlib> at runtime.

=item .HLL "hll_name", "hll_lib"

Define the HLL for the current file. If the string C<hll_lib> isn't empty
this B<compile time pragma> also loads the shared lib for the HLL, so that
integer type constants are working for creating new PMCs.

=item .HLL_map 'CoreType', 'UserType'

Whenever Parrot has to create PMCs inside C code on behalf of the running
user program it consults the current type mapping for the executing HLL
and creates a PMC of type I<'UserType'> instead of I<'CoreType'>, if such
a mapping is defined.

E.g. with this code snippet ...

  .loadlib 'dynlexpad'

  .HLL "Foo", ""
  .HLL_map 'LexPad', 'DynLexPad'

  .sub main :main
    ...

... all subroutines for language I<Foo> would use a dynamic lexpad pmc.

{{ PROPOSAL: stop using integer constants for types RT#45453 }}

=item .sub <identifier> [:<flag> ...]

Define a I<compilation unit> with the label B<identifier>. All code in a
PIR source file must be defined in a compilation unit. See
L<PIR Calling Conventions|imcc/calling_conventions> for available flags.
Optional flags are a list of B<flag>, separated by empty spaces, and empty
spaces only.

{{ PROPOSAL: remove the optional comma in flag list RT#45697 }}

Always paired with C<.end>.

=item .end

End a compilation unit. Always paired with C<.sub>.

=item .emit

Define a I<compilation unit> containing PASM code. Always paired with
C<.eom>.

=item .eom

End a I<compilation unit> containing PASM code. Always paired with
C<.emit>.

=item .local <type> <identifier> [:unique_reg]

Define a local name B<identifier> for this I<compilation unit> and of the
given B<type>. You can define multiple identifiers of the same type by
separating them with commas:

  .local int i, j

The optional C<:unique_reg> modifier will force the register allocator to
associate the identifier with a unique register for the duration of the
compilation unit.

=item .sym <type> <identifier> [:unique_reg]

Same as C<.local>.

{{ PROPOSAL: remove .sym, see RT#45405 }}

=item .lex <identifier>, <reg>

Declare a lexical variable that is an alias for a PMC register. The
PIR compiler calls this method in response to a .lex STRING, PREG
directive. For example, given this preamble:

    .lex "$a", $P0
    $P1 = new 'Integer'

    These two opcodes have an identical effect:

    $P0 = $P1
    store_lex "$a", $P1

    And these two opcodes also have an identical effect:

    $P1 = $P0
    $P1 = find_lex "$a"

=item .const <type> <identifier> = <const>

Define a constant named B<identifier> of type B<type> and assign value
B<const> to it.

=item .globalconst <type> <identifier> = <const>

As C<.const> above, but the defined constant is globally accessible.


=item .namespace <identifier>

Open a new scope block. This "namespace" is not the same as the
.namespace [ <identifier> ] syntax, which is used for storing subroutines
in a particular namespace in the global symbol table.
This directive is useful in cases such as (pseudocode):

  local x = 1;
  print(x);       # prints 1
  do              # open a new namespace/scope block
    local x = 2;  # this x hides the previous x
    print(x);     # prints 2
  end             # close the current namespace
  print(x);       # prints 1 again

All types of common language constructs such as if, for, while, repeat and such
that have nested scopes, can use this directive.

=item .endnamespace <identifier>

Closes the scope block that was opened with .namespace <identifier>.

=item .namespace [ <identifier> ; <identifier> ]

Defines the namespace from this point onwards.  By default the program is not
in any namespace.  If you specify more than one, separated by semicolons, it
creates nested namespaces, by storing the inner namespace object with a C<\0>
prefix in the outer namespace's global pad.

=item .pcc_*

Directives used for Parrot Calling Conventions. These are:

=over 4

=item .pcc_begin and .pcc_end

=item .pcc_begin_return and .pcc_end_return

=item .pcc_begin_yield and .pcc_end_yield

=item .pcc_call

=back

{{ REVIEW: Do we still want/need the "pcc_" prefix? See #45925. }}

=back

=head2 Directives for subroutine parameters and return

=over 4

=item .param <type> <identifier> [:<flag>]*

At the top of a subroutine, declare a local variable, in the mannter
of B<.local>, into which parameter(s) of the current subroutine should
be stored. Available flags:
C<:slurpy>, C<:optional>, C<:opt_flag> and C<:unique_reg>.

=item .param <type> "<identifier>" => <identifier> [:<flag>]*

Define a named parameter. This is syntactic sugar for:

 .param <type> <identifier> :named("<identifier>")

=item .param <reg> [:<flag>]*

{{ Specifying a register for a parameter does not work. See. RT#46455. }}

At the top of a subroutine, specify where parameter(s) of the current
subroutine should be stored.  Available flags:
C<:slurpy>, C<:optional>, C<:opt_flag> and C<:unique_reg>.

=item .return <var> [:<flag> ...]

Between B<.pcc_begin_return> and B<.pcc_end_return>, specify one or
more of the return value(s) of the current subroutine.  Available
flags:
C<:flat>.

=back

=head2 Directives for making a PCC call

=over 4

=item .arg <var> [:<flag> ...]

Between B<.pcc_begin> and B<.pcc_call>, specify an argument to be
passed.  Available flags: C<:flat>.

=item .result <var> [:<flag> ...]

Between B<.pcc_call> and B<.pcc_end>, specify where one or more return
value(s) should be stored.  Available flags:
C<:slurpy>, C<:optional>, and C<:opt_flag>.

=back

=head2 Shorthand directives for PCC call and return

=over 4

=item ([<var1> [:<flag1> ...], ...]) = <var2>([<arg1> [:<flag2> ...], ...])

This is short for:

  .pcc_begin
  .pcc_arg <arg1> <flag2>
  ...
  .pcc_call <var2>
  .result <var1> <flag1>
  ...
  .pcc_end

=item <var> = <var>([arg [:<flag> ...], ...])

=item <var>([arg [:<flag> ...], ...])

=item <var>."_method"([arg [:<flag> ...], ...])

=item <var>._method([arg [:<flag> ...], ...])

Function or method call. These notations are shorthand for a longer
PCC function call with B<.pcc_*> directives. I<var> can denote a
global subroutine, a local B<identifier> or a B<reg>.

{{We should review the (currently inconsistent) specification of the
method name. Currently it can be a bare word, a quoted string or a
string register. See #45859.}}

=item .return ([<var> [:<flag> ...], ...])

Return from the current compilation unit with zero or more values.

The surrounded parentheses are mandatory. Besides making sequence
break more conspicuous, this is necessary to distinguish this syntax
from other uses of the B<.return> directive that will be probably
deprecated.

=item .return <var>(args)

=item .return <var>."somemethod"(args)

=item .return <var>.somemethod(args)

Tail call: call a function or method and return from the sub with the
function or method call return values.

Internally, the call stack doesn't increase because of a tail call, so
you can write recursive functions and not have stack overflows.

=back

=head2 Parameter Passing and Getting Flags

See L<PDD03|pdds/pdd03_calling_conventions.pod> for a description of
the meaning of the flag bits C<SLURPY>, C<OPTIONAL>, C<OPT_FLAG>,
and C<FLAT>, which correspond to the calling convention flags
C<:slurpy>, C<:optional>, C<:opt_flag>, and C<:flat>.

{{ TODO: once these flag bits are solidified by long-term use, then we
may choose to copy appropriate bits of the documentation to here. }}

=head2 Instructions

Instructions may be a valid PASM instruction or anything listed here
below:

=over 4

=item goto <identifier>

B<branch> to B<identifier> (label or subroutine name).

Examples:

  goto END

=item if <var> goto <identifier>

If B<var> evaluates as true, jump to the named B<identifier>. Translate to
B<if var, identifier>.

=item unless <var> goto <identifier>

Unless B<var> evaluates as true, jump to the named B<identifier>. Translate 
to B<unless var, identifier>.

=item if null <var> goto <identifier>

If B<var> evaluates as null, jump to the named B<identifier>. Translate to
B<if_null var, identifier>.

=item unless null <var> goto <identifier>

Unless B<var> evaluates as null, jump to the named B<identifier>. Translate
to B<unless_null var, identifier>.

=item if <var1> <relop> <var2> goto <identifier>

The B<relop> can be: B<E<lt>, E<lt>=, ==, != E<gt>= E<gt>> which translate 
to the PASM opcodes B<lt>, B<le>, B<eq>, B<ne>, B<ge> or B<gt>. If B<var1> 
B<relop> B<var2> evaluates as true, jump to the named B<identifier>.

=item unless <var1> <relop> <var2> goto <identifier>

The B<relop> can be: B<E<lt>, E<lt>=, ==, != E<gt>= E<gt>> which translate 
to the PASM opcodes B<lt>, B<le>, B<eq>, B<ne>, B<ge> or B<gt>. Unless B<var1>
B<relop> B<var2> evaluates as true, jump to the named B<identifier>.

=item <var1> = <var2>

Assign a value. Translates to B<set var1, var2>.

=item <var1> = <unary> <var2>

The B<unary>s B<!>, B<-> and B<~> generate B<not>, B<neg> and B<bnot> ops.

=item <var1> = <var2> <binary> <var3>

The B<binary>s B<+>, B<->, B<*>, B</>, B<%> and B<**> generate
B<add>, B<sub>, B<mul>, B<div>, B<mod> and B<pow> arithmetic ops.
B<binary> B<.> is B<concat> and only valid for string arguments.

B<E<lt>E<lt>> and B<E<gt>E<gt>> are arithmetic shifts B<shl> and B<shr>.
B<E<gt>E<gt>E<gt>> is the logical shift B<lsr>.

B<&&>, B<||> and B<~~> are logic B<and>, B<or> and B<xor>.

B<&>, B<|> and B<~> are binary B<band>, B<bor> and B<bxor>.

=item <var1> <op>= <var2>

This is equivalent to 
B<E<lt>var1E<gt> = E<lt>var1E<gt> E<lt>opE<gt> E<lt>var2E<gt>>. Where
B<op> is called an assignment operator and can be any of the following
binary operators described earlier: B<+>, B<->, B<*>, B</>, B<%>, B<.>, 
B<&>, B<|>, B<~>, B<E<lt>E<lt>>, B<E<gt>E<gt>> or B<E<gt>E<gt>E<gt>>.

=item <var> = <var> [ <var> ]

This generates either a keyed B<set> operation or B<substr var, var,
var, 1> for string arguments and an integer key.

=item <var> = <var> [ <key> ]

where C<key> is:

 <var1> .. <var2>

returns a slice defined starting at C<var1> and ending at C<var2>.

 .. <var2>

returns a slice starting at the first element, and ending at C<var2>.

 <var1> ..

returns a slice starting at C<var1> to the end of the array.

see src/pmc/slice.pmc
and t/pmc/slice.t.

=item <var> [ <var> ] = <var>

A keyed B<set> operation or the assign B<substr> op with a length of
1.

=item <var> = new '<type>'

Create a new PMC of type B<type> stored in B<var>. Translate to
B<new var, 'type'>.

=item <var1> = new '<type>', <var2>

Create a new PMC of type B<type> stored in B<var1> and using B<var2> as PMC
containing initialization data. Translate to B<new var1, 'type', var2>

=item <var1> = defined <var2>

Assign to B<var1> the value for definedness of B<var2>. Translate to
B<defined var1, var2>.

=item <var1> = defined <var2> [ <var3> ]

B<defined var1, var2[var3]> the keyed op.

=item global "string" = <var>

{{ DEPRECATED: op store_global was deprecated }}

=item <var> = global "string"

{{ DEPRECATED: op find_global was deprecated }}

=item <var1> = clone <var2>

Assing to B<var1> a clone of B<var2>. Translate to B<clone var1, var2>.

=item <var> = addr <identifier>

Assign to B<var> the address of label identified by B<identifier>. Translate
to B<set_addr var, var>.

=item <var> = null

Set B<var> to null. Translate to B<null <var>.

=item addr

Return the address of a label.
