The book will have the following chapters. Note that the number and order of
intended chapters listed here may not directly correspond to the filenames in
this folder:

 1) Overview
 2) Getting Started
 3) PIR Basics
 4) PIR Subroutines
 5) PASM
 6) Standard Library
 7) Testing and Debugging
 8) Parrot Architecture
 9) Parrot Compiler Tools
10) High-Level Languages
11) PMCs
12) Opcodes and Runcores
13) NCI (proposed, if there is enough material about using NCI to warrant a chapter)
14) Reference

This list will probably change as time goes on, as more topics need to be
covered. I'm sure other authors are going to think it's stupid and completely
rearrange it to be better.

Top-level headings in each chapter are level1 headings. All sub-headings in the chapter
are level 2 and below. All pages in the book should contain the VIM suffix (which is
a codingstd for all of the Parrot repo) and the Pseudopod cheatsheet.
