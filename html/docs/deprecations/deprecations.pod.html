<h1><a name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>This page exists to systematically document all deprecations that apply to core Parrot code.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t hate our users and while we love ripping out crufty old code,
we also don&#39;t want anyone developing code on top of Parrot to dread paying the &#34;upgrade tax&#34; when moving from one supported version to the next.</p>

<p>The idea behind this page is that by following the instructions for each version transition,
developers of HLLs and libraries can have a well&#45;known and deterministic upgrade path.</p>

<p>Any new deprecations must be described on the appropriate page and summarized here before being committed to master.
This deprecation policy will be instituted shortly before the 2.6 release.</p>

<p>Although we will attempt to add notices for previous version transitions,
these lists may be incomplete.</p>

<p>Notifications for the 2.6&#45;&#62;2.9 transition and later will be complete.</p>

<p>For instructions on how to deprecate Parrot code,
please see: <em>how_to_deprecate.pod</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="Changes_Between_4.9_and_5.0"
>Changes Between 4.9 and 5.0</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Moved &#34;.&#34; in the library search paths from the beginning to the end.</li>

<p>&#45; high impact expected: build systems need to change their build and tests to favor their new libraries over already installed ones,
to use absolute paths or add &#45;L./ &#45;X./.
load_bytecode,
.include and load_language might load now different files,
if they exist in &#34;./&#34; AND in the proper library location.
To keep the old behavior use parrot &#45;L./ &#45;X./ or set the environment variables PARROT_INCLUDE and PARROT_LIBRARY to &#34;./&#34;</p>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Changes_Between_3.3_and_3.6"
>Changes Between 3.3 and 3.6</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Special Purpose NCI Parameter Types</li>

<p>&#45; moderate impact expected: some NCI&#45;using code needs to be rewritten</p>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Changes_Between_3.0_and_3.3"
>Changes Between 3.0 and 3.3</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>pkg&#45;config Support</li>

<p>&#45; low impact expected: feature has been unusable since at least 1.0</p>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Changes_Between_2.9_and_3.0"
>Changes Between 2.9 and 3.0</a></h2>

<p>This list is a summary.
A more complete description and migration path for each change is at <em>deprecations_3_0.pod</em>.</p>

<p>Any deprecations occurring after the 2.9.0 release require an accompanying notice here and <em>deprecations_3_0.pod</em>,
so the list should be exhaustive.</p>

<p>If you find a deprecation that should be listed here,
file a ticket <a href='https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/new'>https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/new</a> or hop on #parrot on irc.parrot.org and let us know.</p>

<p>&#45; medium impact expected: these functions have been deprecated for a while.</p>

<li>Method lower in String PMC.
TT #1606</li>

<p>&#45; low impact expected: has been deprecated for a while.</p>

<li>Final removal of mutable strings leftovers.

<p>&#45; Op <code>concat_s_s</code> was removed.
Trivial change to <code>concat_s_s_s</code> or slightly better solution to refactor with StringBuilder.</p>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Changes_Between_2.6_and_2.9"
>Changes Between 2.6 and 2.9</a></h2>

<p>This list is a summary.
A more complete description and migration path for each change is at <em>deprecations_2_9.pod</em>.</p>

<p>If you find a deprecation that should be listed here,
file a ticket <a href='https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/new'>https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/new</a> or hop on #parrot on irc.parrot.org and let us know.</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove charset opcodes.
TT #1778</li>

<p>&#45; low impact expected: the conversion to encoding opcodes is straightforward.</p>

<li>Remove ParrotPCCINVOKE.</li>

<p>&#45; negligible impact expected: this function has been deprecated for a long time.</p>

<li>Remove Parrot_find_global_s and Parrot_store_global_s TT #1660</li>

<p>&#45; low impact expected: these functions were used rarely outside Parrot.</p>

<li>Change find_lex opcode behaviour.</li>

<p>&#45; low impact expected: this function has been deprecated for awhile.</p>

<li>Eliminate Raw NCI.</li>

<p>&#45; negligible impact expected: this functionality has little use that doesn&#39;t result in a segfault</p>

<li>Remove Parrot_get_runtime_prefix.
TT #1191</li>

<p>&#45; Zero impact expected,
it&#39;s been unused since long time.</p>

<li>RemoveIsTty Remove is_tty methods.
#1689</li>

<p>&#45; negligible impact expected.</p>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Changes_Between_2.3_and_2.6"

<ul>
<li>Remove sizeof op.</li>

<p>No replacement currently exists.

<p>&#45; negligible impact expected: this op was not widely used</p>

<li>Replace STRING_is_null with Parrot_str_is_null TT #1585</li>

<p>&#45; moderate impact expected: simple textual substitution for C code dealing with STRING* values</p>

<li>Remove in&#45;place substr op variants.
TT #1450</li>

<p>&#45; high impact expected: most PIR code dealing with string substitution will need to be updated</p>
