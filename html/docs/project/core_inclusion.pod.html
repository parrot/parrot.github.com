<p>This document address questions we will consider when deciding whether or not to move a piece of code into core.</p>

<h1><a name="ABSTRACT"
>ABSTRACT</a></h1>

<p>Occasionally useful bits of code will arise that someone thinks should be made core components of Parrot.
This document lists some of the questions we&#39;ll consider when deciding whether this is a good idea.</p>

<h1><a name="INTRODUCTION"
>INTRODUCTION</a></h1>

<p>When considering whether to add code to Parrot,
we&#39;ll ask ourselves and the developer(s) the following questions,
in approximate order of importance.
This is not an exhaustive list as much as a guide to help us make sure we think through the implications of adopting and supporting a new core component.</p>

<ul>
<li>What benefit will the code provide to Parrot and its users?</li>

<p>How will it help Parrot and its users to further their goals?
Examples include better debugging,
increased execution speed,
better code generation and improved modularity.</p>

<li>How does its benefit outweigh its maintenance (testing,
updating,
support,
deprecation,
etc.) burden?</li>

<p>This is somewhat subjective,
but the main question concerns how high the maintenance burden will be relative to the benefits the code will provide.</p>

<li>Is the code something that most of Parrot&#39;s users will be happy to find?</li>

<p>More specifically,
will the addition make development more fun for the majority of Parrot&#39;s users.
A generic optimization framework would help most projects and have a good chance of inclusion.
A specialized math library or an HLL&#45;specific datatype won&#39;t be of use to most projects and should live as a separate project.</p>

<li>How well&#45;documented and tested is it?</li>

<p>If we can&#39;t figure out how it works or if it does what it claims,
it&#39;ll have a hard getting accepted.
We have enough undertested and underdocumented code already.</p>

<li>Which committers have expressed willingness to maintain it?
How familiar are they with it?</li>

<p>Core code needs to be maintained.
If an experienced core committer expresses willingness to maintain an addition,
that&#39;s good.
If that committer has worked with the code,
that&#39;s better.</p>

<li>Does the code have any portability issues?</li>

<p>We want Parrot to run on as many platforms as possible.
If the code has any OS&#45; or CPU&#45;specific components,
are they well&#45;separated and easy to port to other systems?</p>

<li>What impact does it have on Parrot&#39;s install footprint?</li>

<li>How will having the code in core help Parrot more than having it in an external project would?</li>

<li>How will the addition impact Parrot&#39;s runtime characteristics,
e.g.
its memory usage,
speed,
startup time,
etc?</li>

<li>What drawbacks will result from including the addition in core?</li>
