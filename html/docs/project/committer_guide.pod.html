<h1><a name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>From <em>docs/project/roles_responsibilities.pod</em>:</p>

<pre>  Contributors who submit numerous, high&#45;quality patches may be considered
  to become a Committer. Committers have commit access to the full Parrot
  repository, but generally work only on one or more subprojects; Committer
  categories are described below. Contributors may considered for commit
  access either by being nominated by another Committer, or by asking for it.</pre>

<h1><a name="ADDING_NEW_FILES"
>ADDING NEW FILES</a></h1>

<p>To add a new file to Parrot, in your git working copy use the command:</p>

<pre>  % git add &#60;filename&#62;</pre>

<h1><a name="MANIFEST"
>MANIFEST</a></h1>

<p>Be sure to update the MANIFEST when you&#39;ve added new files. You do this by running:</p>

<pre>  % perl tools/dev/mk_manifest_and_skip.pl</pre>

<h1><a name="IGNORED_FILES"
>IGNORED FILES</a></h1>

<p>Files generated by Parrot at build time should get ignored such that Cgit status&#62; doesn&#39;t pick them up. They also need to get added to MANIFEST.SKIP so that Parrot&#39;s configuration mechanism doesn&#39;t complain about extra files. You can tell git to ignore files by adding them to <em>.gitignore</em>.</p>

<h1><a name="TESTS_BEFORE_COMMITTING;_MAKE_CODETEST"
>TESTS BEFORE COMMITTING; MAKE CODETEST</a></h1>

<p>Your Parrot working copy must <code>make</code> successfully before committing your changes to the repository.</p>

<p>It would be best practice to run <code>make test</code> and make sure that your change hasn&#39;t broken anything before committing. However, as <code>make test</code> takes a long time, it is recommended to run at least <code>make codetest</code>. This target runs only the file metadata and the basic coding standards tests.</p>

<p>In case you want to check the POD of your changed file, you can run <code>perl t/codingstd/pod_syntax.t path/to/my/file </code>.</p>

<h1><a name="LICENSE"
>LICENSE</a></h1>

<p>Each text file needs to have near its beginning the line (or equivalent depending upon the current language&#39;s comment character):</p>

<pre>  # Copyright (C) &#60;creation_year&#62;&#45;&#60;current_year&#62;, Parrot Foundation.</pre>

<h1><a name="REMOVING_FILES"
>REMOVING FILES</a></h1>

<p>To remove a file from the Parrot source, you need to use the <code>git rm</code> command:</p>

<pre>  % git rm &#60;filename&#62;</pre>

<p>Removing files is much the same as adding files in that you need to run <em>tools/dev/mk_manifest_and_skip.pl</em> to create the MANIFEST and MANIFEST.SKIP files appropriately. Also, you should check that you&#39;ve not broken anything by running <code>make test</code> before committing the removal to the repository.</p>
