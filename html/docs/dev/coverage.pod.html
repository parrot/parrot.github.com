<h1><a name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>&#34;make cover&#34; is a very useful tool which generates reports on how well tested parrot code is.
The coverage reports are outputted in various formats in cover_db/ after <code>make cover</code> has run.
The final result of make cover is a listing of parrot&#39;s source files and a matching percentage of how well covered that file is by the tests.</p>

<p>Obviously,
the first step would be to get parrot and build it.
See <em>docs/intro.pod</em> for more information.
To run &#34;make cover&#34; you must first install some Perl tools to aid in the creation of these reports.
Make Cover requires the &#34;Devel::Cover&#34; perl module.
If you are running Debian/Ubuntu type systems you can run</p>

<pre>  sudo apt&#45;get install libdevel&#45;cover&#45;perl</pre>

<p>or using CPAN:</p>

<pre>  perl &#45;MCPAN &#45;e &#39;install Devel::Cover&#39;</pre>

<p>and that will install the required module. Other OSes may have this packaged as well, so try to find it. If you do not have a packaged version of this module, head over to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel&#45;Cover/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel&#45;Cover/</a> and install it.</p>

<h1><a name="PROCESS"
>PROCESS</a></h1>

<p>Next, make sure your working parrot directory is as clean as can be. Any left over files can cause problems when generating the coverage reports.</p>

<pre>  make realclean</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>  git clean &#45;dfx</pre>

<p>Next, run <code>make test</code> to see if there are any failing tests. Finally you can type in <code>make cover</code> and leave to make a sandwich and something to drink because it&#39;s probably going to take a <i>long</i> time to run. If you run into trouble, <code>make fulltest</code> may be of some assistance.</p>

<h1><a name="COVER"
>COVER</a></h1>

<p>If you have run <code>make fullcover</code> before, you know how long it takes to execute that command. Recently a new tool <code>make cover</code> has been added that is much faster, but does not run tests in all runcores.</p>
