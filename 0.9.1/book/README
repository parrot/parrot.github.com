The book will have the following chapters. Note that the number and order of
intended chapters listed here may not directly correspond to the filenames in
this folder:

 1) Overview
 2) Getting Started
 3) High-Level Languages
 4) Parrot Compiler Tools
 5) Parrot Intermediate Representation (PIR)
 6) Parrot Assembly Language (PASM)
 7) Writing your own PMCs
 8) Testing and Debugging
 9) Standard Library (maybe)

This list will probably change as time goes on, as more topics need to be
covered.

Top-level headings in each chapter (the chapter title) are level 1 headings.
All sub-headings in the chapter are level 2 and below. All chapter files should
contain the VIM suffix (which is a codingstd for all of the Parrot repo).
