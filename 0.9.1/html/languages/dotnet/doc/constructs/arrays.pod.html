<h1><a name="Translating_Arrays"
>Translating Arrays</a></h1>

<p>This document discusses .NET arrays and how they can be supported in Parrot.</p>

<h2><a name="The_.NET_Model"
>The .NET Model</a></h2>

<p>At the runtime level only one&#45;dimensional arrays of fixed size,
a single type and with first element at index zero are supported.
Anything beyond this is supported through the System.Array class.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Parrot_Model"
>The Parrot Model</a></h2>

<p>Arrays are implemented using PMCs.
PMCs have keyed v&#45;table operations (that is,
v&#45;table functions that as one of their parameters take a key).
For arrays the key is the array index and is expected to be an integer.
A number of PMCs exist ready to use in the Parrot source tree,
however languages are free to provide their own.
The v&#45;table mechanism to access elements means that the interface to the array is always the same,
so translated .NET code will be able to handle being passed a Perl array even though their behaviours are very different (Perl arrays are resizable,
for example,
where as .NET arrays are of fixed length).</p>

<h2><a name="Translating_Array_Instructions"
>Translating Array Instructions</a></h2>

<p>Arrays are created using a &#34;newarr&#34; instruction which takes the type that the array will contain.
As the notion of .NET value types isn&#39;t really handled so gracefully in the translation,
there is a need to special&#45;case them,
mapping any type of array that stores integers to be a FixedIntegerArray and any array that stores floating point numbers to be a FixedFloatArray.
All other types get stored in a FixedPMCArray.</p>

<p>Array loads and stores can be translated trivially to the PIR keyed syntax.</p>

<pre>  $I1 = $P1[$I0] # load
  $P1[$I0] = $I1 # store</pre>

<p>There $P1 is the array PMC, $I0 is the array index and $I1 is the register the value is loaded in to or the value to be stored.</p>

<p>The only remaining array instruction is ldlen, which loads the element count of the array onto the stack. This maps to the elements v&#45;table call in Parrot.</p>

<pre>  $I0 = elements $P0</pre>

<p>Where $P0 is the array PMC and $I0 will hold the number of elements.</p>
