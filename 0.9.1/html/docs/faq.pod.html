>GENERAL QUESTIONS</a></h1>

<h2><a name="What_is_Parrot?"
>What is Parrot?</a></h2>

<p>Parrot is a virtual machine for dynamic languages such as PHP,
Perl,
Python,
Ruby,
Scheme,
Tcl,
etc.
It compiles and executes bytecode,
but is also designed to act as an interpreter.</p>

<h2><a name="Why_did_you_call_it_&#34;Parrot&#34;?"
>Why did you call it &#34;Parrot&#34;?</a></h2>

<p>The name &#34;Parrot&#34; started with Simon Cozens&#39;s April Fool&#39;s Joke (<a href='http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/04/01/parrot.htm'><a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/04/01/parrot.htm">http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/04/01/parrot.htm</a></a>) where Larry Wall and Guido van Rossum announced the merger of the Perl and Python languages.</p>

<p>A year later,
when we were looking for a name for our virtual machine that could run both Perl and Python,
it seemed like a perfect fit.</p>

<h2><a name="Is_Parrot_the_same_as_Perl_6?"
>Is Parrot the same as Perl 6?</a></h2>

<p>No.
Perl 6 is just one of the languages that will run on Parrot.
For information about Perl 6 on Parrot (a.k.a Rakudo),
see <a href='TODO#perl6%2F'>&#34;perl6/&#34; in languages</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Can_I_use_Parrot_today?"
>Can I use Parrot today?</a></h2>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Although Parrot is currently still under development,
Parrot has been usable for a long time.
The primary way to use Parrot is to write Parrot Intermediate Representation (PIR),
described in <a href='TODO#pdds%2Fpdd19_pir.pod'>PDD19</a>.
PIR is a high&#45;level assembly language.
See the <a href='TODO'>examples</a> directory.</p>

<h2><a name="When_can_I_expect_to_use_Parrot_with_a_real_programming_language?"
>When can I expect to use Parrot with a <i>real</i> programming language?</a></h2>

<p>While the languages that are shipped with our pre&#45;release versions of parrot are in varying states of development,
many of them are quite functional.
See <a href='https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/Languages'>https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/Languages</a> for information about the various languages that are targeting parrot.</p>

<h2><a name="What_language_is_Parrot_written_in?"
>What language is Parrot written in?</a></h2>

<p>While much of the build system currently uses perl 5.8.0,
the parrot runtime is C89.</p>

<h2><a name="Why_register&#45;based_and_not_stack&#45;based?"
>Why register&#45;based and not stack&#45;based?</a></h2>

<p>Stack&#45;based virtual machines and interpreters (JVM,
.NET,
Perl5,
etc) are both common and successful.
However,
register&#45;based implementations give us a number of benefits: Less code needed to manipulate the stack frequently,
access to decades of optimization for register&#45;based hardware,
and a minimization of stack overflow security problems.
For many programmers,
our register architecture just <i>feels</i> more normal than doing everything on a stack too.</p>

<h2><a name="Why_aren&#39;t_you_using_external_tool_or_library_X?"
>Why aren&#39;t you using external tool or library <i>X</i>?</a></h2>

<p>The most common issues are:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="License_compatibility"
>License compatibility</a></dt>
Parrot uses the Artistic License 2.0,
which is compatible with the GNU GPL.
This means you can combine Parrot with GPL&#39;ed code.
<dt><a name="Platform_compatibility"
>Platform compatibility</a></dt>
Parrot has to work on most of Perl 5&#39;s platforms,
as well as a few of its own.
Perl 5 runs on eighty platforms; Parrot must run on Unix,
Windows,
Mac OS (X and Classic),
VMS,
Crays,
Windows CE,
and Palm OS,
just to name a few.
Among its processor architectures will be x86,
SPARC,
Alpha,
IA&#45;64,
ARM,
and 68x00 (Palms and old Macs).
If something doesn&#39;t work on all of these,
we can&#39;t use it in core Parrot.</dl>
