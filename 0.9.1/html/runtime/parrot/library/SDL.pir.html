<h1><a name="NAME"
>NAME</a></h1>

<p>SDL &#45; Parrot extension for SDL bindings</p>

<h1><a name="SYNOPSIS"
>SYNOPSIS</a></h1>

<p>None.</p>

<p>You probably shouldn&#39;t use this library directly,
unless you&#39;re writing your own wrappers around the SDL NCI code or if you&#39;re calling the NCI functions directly.</p>

<p>In that case,
I&#39;m perfectly happy saying &#34;Hey buddy,
you&#39;re on your own!&#34;</p>

<h1><a name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>This is the library that contains all of the actual NCI bindings and Parrot data structure definitions to work with SDL from Parrot.
Normal people,
run away to <a href='TODO'>SDL::App</a> right now instead.
This is pretty low&#45;level stuff and you shouldn&#39;t have to use it or even know that it&#39;s here if you want to work with SDL from Parrot.</p>

<p>On the other hand,
if you want to use these functions directly,
write your own wrappers,
or add wrappers that aren&#39;t already here,
you should know how it works.</p>

<h2><a name="The_SDL_Namespace"
>The SDL Namespace</a></h2>

<p>The <code>SDL</code> namespace holds only a few functions right now,
initializers for various libraries.
These load the PASM code that actually creates the SDL NCI bindings and initialize all of the SDL&#45;specific data structures needed to access structs passed to and returned from SDL calls.
There&#39;s no need to load sound components if you don&#39;t have sound installed,
for example.</p>

<p>Each struct layout has its own function that creates and stores the appropriate data structure.
The order of calling really matters here,
as some structs contain other structs.</p>

<p>When you load this file with <code>load_bytecode</code>,
it initializes the <code>SDL_video</code> subsystem.
You&#39;ll have to use the appropriate IMC modules or initialize the other subsystems manually.</p>

<p>The subsystem initalizers include:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="_init_video()"
>_init_video()</a></dt>
Initialize the video subsystem.
You shouldn&#39;t ever need to call this directly.
In fact,
don&#39;t count on it sticking around.
It may not.
Then again,
it might.
<dt><a name="_init_image()"
>_init_image()</a></dt>
Initialize the <code>SDL_image</code> subsystem.
If you don&#39;t have the appropriate library installed,
this won&#39;t work very well.
You&#39;ll probably want to use the SDL::Image library anyway,
which calls this for you.
<dt><a name="_init_ttf()"
>_init_ttf()</a></dt>
Initialize the <code>SDL_ttf</code> subsystem.
If you don&#39;t have the appropriate library installed,
this won&#39;t work very well.
You&#39;ll probably want to use the SDL::Font library anyway,
which calls this for you.</dl>

<h2><a name="The_SDL::NCI_Namespace"
>The SDL::NCI Namespace</a></h2>

<p>Besides all of the actual NCI subs,
there&#39;s one additional subroutine in the SDL::NCI namespace.</p>

<p><code>fetch_layout()</code> takes one argument,
a string containing the name of the SDL_* data structure layout PMC to return.
You can then <code>assign</code> the layout to an <code>UnManagedStruct</code> or <code>ManagedStruct</code> PMC to assign to and read from various struct members.</p>

<p>Note that the name of the layout has the leading <code>SDL_</code> prefix removed; to fetch the layout for an <code>SDL_Rect</code> struct,
ask for <code>Rect</code>.</p>

<p>This currently doesn&#39;t do much if you request an unknown layout.
Suggestions welcome.</p>

<p>In addition to the various SDL data structures,
this makes the following other layouts available:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rect_Array</li>

<p>An array of SDL_Rect structs.
Use this for such things as passing multiple rects to a surface update function,
for example.
Note that you&#39;ll have to update the element at index 1 with the proper count of the number of rects in the array.</p>

<p>If this confuses you,
see <code>SDL::Surface::update_rects()</code> and imagine how <i>I</i> felt when I wrote it!</p>
</ul>
