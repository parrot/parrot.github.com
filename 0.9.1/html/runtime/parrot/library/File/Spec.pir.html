<pre>    .local int classtype
    .local pmc spec

    load_bytecode &#39;File/Spec.pir&#39;

    new spec, &#39;File::Spec&#39;

    .local pmc x

    x= spec.&#39;catdir&#39;( &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39; )</pre>

<p>which returns &#39;a/b/c&#39; under Unix.</p>

<h1><a name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>This module is designed to support operations commonly performed on file specifications (usually called &#34;file names&#34;, but not to be confused with the contents of a file, or Perl&#39;s file handles), such as concatenating several directory and file names into a single path, or determining whether a path is rooted. It is based on code directly taken from MakeMaker 5.17, code written by Andreas K&#246;nig, Andy Dougherty, Charles Bailey, Ilya Zakharevich, Paul Schinder, and others.</p>

<p>Since these functions are different for most operating systems, each set of OS specific routines is available in a separate module, including:</p>

<pre>    File::Spec::Unix
    *File::Spec::Mac
    *File::Spec::OS2
    File::Spec::Win32
    *File::Spec::VMS</pre>

<p>*These modules have not yet been created in this release.</p>

<p>The module appropriate for the current OS is automatically loaded by File::Spec. Since some modules (like VMS) make use of facilities available only under that OS, it may not be possible to load all modules under all operating systems.</p>

<p>Since File::Spec is object oriented, subroutines should not be called directly, and since parrot does not yet support class methods, subroutines should be called as object methods.</p>
