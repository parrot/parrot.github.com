=head1 OVERVIEW

IMCC is the B<I>nterB<m>ediate B<C>ode B<C>ompiler for Parrot.  It's
integrated into the C<parrot> executable.

IMCC compiles a language called Parrot Intermediate Representation (PIR).
PIR is the primary target of language implementations. PIR code files usually
have the extension C<.pir>. At times in the past the extension C<.imc> was
used as well, but C<.pir> is preferred and C<.imc> will soon be deprecated.

This document describes available IMCC documentation, located in
F<docs/imcc> unless otherwise described. 

See also the general Parrot documentation, located in F<docs>.
