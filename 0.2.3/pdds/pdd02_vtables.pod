=head1 NAME

docs/pdds/pdd02_vtables.pod - Common vtable format for all variables

=head1 ABSTRACT

This PDD presents the vtable entries, and their order, that all
variables MUST provide.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

All parrot variables hide their guts behind a magic parrot structure
generally referred to as a PMC, or Parrot Magic Cookie. Nothing outside
the core of parrot (in fact, nothing outside the data type's vtable
routines) should infer anything about a PMC (hence the Magic part).

The first parameter to any vtable routine should be the current interpreter.
The second parameter should be the PMC itself.

vtables are neat because they decouple the interface and
implementation of various object functions. This does mean, though,
that you need to either know what functions are available and what
they do, or have some method of finding out. It's faster if you know
which vtable entry does what, so that's the method parrot's using.

The actual vtable structure contains pointers to functions that
implement the methods for that particular vtable.  All pointers
must point to valid functions with appropriate prototypes.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

=head2 vtable functions

This is a list of each of the vtable methods, their prototypes, and
a description of the method.

The following functions are singleton functions. (There are no keyed
versions of these)

=over 4

=item void init(INTERP, PMC* self)

The init vtable method takes an unused PMC as a parameter and turns
it into a PMC appropriate for the class owning the vtable. Called as a
class method.  There is also a form that accepts a PMC initializer as
a third argument.

=item void init_pmc(INTERP, PMC* self, PMC* initializer)

This form of the init method takes a single initializer parameter. The
initializer is an array that contains keys and values. The meaning of
the keys and their corresponding values is left up to the PMC.

Keys are either strings or integers. If strings, the PMC is
responsible for figuring out what the string represents. If integers,
it means the meaning has been pre-figured based on meta-information
from the class.

For example, if a class has the known properties "Size", "Dimension"
and "Color", they may be assigned the values 100, 101, and 102. If the
creator of the PMC knows enough about the class to make the
translation to numbers it may; otherwise, the raw strings may be used.
So, for the declaration:

   my @foo Size(12), Dimension(3), Color("Green");

the init array may be [100, 12, 101, 3, 102, "Green"] or ["Size", 12,
"Dimension", 3, "Color", "Green"]. Note that, in all cases, the array
is an array of PMCs. (So you get either an int PMC or a string PMC in
the list of keys).

=item void init_pmc_props(INTERP, PMC* self, PMC* initializer, PMC* properties)

XXX: what does this do?

=item void morph(INTERP, PMC* self, INTVAL type)

Turn the PMC into a PMC of type C<type>. If the morphing can't be
done in any reasonable way -- for instance if an integer is asked to turn
into an Array -- then the PMC is first destroyed, then recreated as an
empty PMC of the new type.

This method is primarily used when the interpreter has need of
coercing a PMC to a particular type, and isn't meant as a general
purpose casting tool. Compilers should only emit valid transformations.

=item void mark(INTERP, PMC* self)

Called by the DOD when it is sweeping through the PMCs and has detected
that this PMC is both alive and has a custom mark routine (as indicated
by the custom mark PMC flag).

If a PMC has this flag set, then it is responsible for marking all buffers
and PMCs under its control as alive. If it does not, those PMCs or buffers
may be collected later. This method does I<not> have to call the
C<mark> method on any PMCs it marks--the DOD system takes care of
that. (So no need to recurse into aggregate PMCs or anything of the sort).

This method may allocate no memory from Parrot, nor may it alter
Parrot's internal structures. It should have no side-effects from the
C level either.

This routine may B<not> throw an exception.

=item void destroy(INTERP, PMC* self)

This method is called by the DOD when it determines that a PMC is
dead and that the PMC has marked itself as having a destroy method.

When this method finishes, the PMC will be marked as dead. As such you
should make sure that you do I<not> leave any references to it in any
parrot structure by the end of the method.

This method may I<not> throw an exception. It will be ignored if it does.

=item PMC* getprop(INTERP, PMC* self, STRING* key)

Return the value from the property hash of B<self> keyed by B<key>.
The key should not be NULL.

=item void setprop(INTERP, PMC* self, STRING* key, PMC* value)

Set the value in the property hash of B<self> that is keyed by B<key> to
the value of B<value>. The key should not be NULL.

=item void delprop(INTERP, PMC* self, STRING* key)

Delete the value from the property hash of B<self> keyed by B<key>.
The key should not be NULL.

=item PMC* getprops(INTERP, PMC* self)

Return the entire property hash for B<self>.

=back

The following functions have a plain form, a _keyed form, and
a _keyed_int form. The keyed forms take a PMC* or INTVAL for I<each> PMC
parameter.  The PMC* parameter for each PMC is NULL if there is no
key for that PMC; this means that that argument is unkeyed.

In some cases, the caller I<must> provide a non-NULL key.  Those cases are
explicitly stated below.  In the other cases, you may have to implement the
keyed vtable methods and check for a NULL B<self> key even if you are
implementing a non-aggregate type.  If the B<self> key is non-NULL and the
PMC class is a non-aggregate type, the _keyed_* methods should throw an
exception.

If you do not implement the _keyed_int methods, the default will convert
the INTVAL into a key PMC* and call the corresponding _keyed method.

The keyed methods should I<NOT> assume that the key pointer will be
valid after the method exits.  The pointer may be to a
stack variable in the calling function.

=over 4

=item INTVAL type(INTERP, PMC* self)

Return the type of the PMC. Type is a unique tag associated with the
PMC when the PMC's class is loaded. Negative numbers are considered
interpreter-specific, non-public types.

=item INTVAL type_keyed_int(INTERP, PMC* self, INTVAL key)

=item INTVAL type_keyed_str(INTERP, PMC* self, STRING* key)

Return the type of the PMC indexed by B<key>.  The B<key> parameter
is guaranteed not to be NULL for this method.

=item UINTVAL subtype(INTERP, PMC* self, INTVAL type)

Return the subtype of a PMC. (Note that this may be unimplemented,
and may go away). This is intended to return information about the
PMC--what type of number or string it is, whether it's a scalar, hash,
array, or list, and suchlike things.

=item STRING* name(INTERP, PMC* self)

Return the name of the class for the PMC.

=item PMC* clone(INTERP, PMC* self)

Return a clone of yourself.

=item PMC* find_method(INTERP, PMC* self, STRING* method_name)

each time, or be capable of dealing with the returned sub PMCs being
reused.

Return the constant TRUE if the PMC is true, or FALSE if the PMC is
false. The definition of truth for a given PMC will depend on the type
of the PMC: for a scalar, it may be as simple as 0 or "" being false,
and any other value being true.

=item PMC* get_pmc(INTERP, PMC* self)

Return the PMC for this PMC. While this may seem nonsensical, it's
useful in several circumstances. If the thing being accessed may
return something odd, for example a reference, it may return a
