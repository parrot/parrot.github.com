<p>This file defines a set of utility functions for the FileHandle PMC used by all operating systems.
For the primary public I/O API,
see <em><a href="api.c.html">src/io/api.c</a></em>.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="INTVAL_Parrot_io_parse_open_flags"
><b><code>INTVAL Parrot_io_parse_open_flags</b></code></a></dt>
Parses a Parrot string for file open mode flags (<code>r</code> for read,
<code>w</code> for write,
<code>a</code> for append,
and <code>p</code> for pipe) and returns the combined generic bit flags.
<dt><a name="STRING_*_Parrot_io_make_string"
><b><code>STRING *Parrot_io_make_string</b></code></a></dt>
Creates a STRING* suitable for returning results from IO read functions.
The passed in <code>buf</code> parameter can:
<ol>
<li>Point to a NULL STRING</li>

<li>Point to a real STRING</li>

<li>Point to a fake STRING with (strstart,
bufused) holding the *buffer information.</li>
</ol>
In the third case,
the buffer or STRING must be able to hold the required amount of data.
For cases 1 and 2,
a NULL <code>strstart</code> tells this function to allocate the STRING memory.
<dt><a name="void_Parrot_io_set_os_handle"
><b><code>void Parrot_io_set_os_handle</b></code></a></dt>
Sets the <code>os_handle</code> attribute of the FileHandle object,
which stores the low&#45;level filehandle for the OS.Currently,
this pokes directly into the C struct of the FileHandle PMC.
This needs to change to a general interface that can be used by all subclasses and polymorphic equivalents of FileHandle.
For now,
hiding it behind a function,
so it can be cleanly changed later.Possibly,
this function should reset some characteristics of the object (like buffer and file positions) to their default values.
