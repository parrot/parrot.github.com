<h1><a name="Translating_Value_Types"
>Translating Value Types <a href='#_top'><img alt='^' border=0 src='../../../../../resources/up.gif'></a></a></h1>

<p>This document discusses .NET&#39;s value types and how their semantics can be realised on the Parrot platform.</p>

<h2><a name="About_.NET&#39;s_Value_Types"
>About .NET&#39;s Value Types <a href='#_top'><img alt='^' border=0 src='../../../../../resources/up.gif'></a></a></h2>

<p>The name pretty much says it all &#45; value types are simply types that exhibit value semantics (that is,
anywhere that,
say,
an integer would be copied a value type will almost be copied; think passing,
assignment etc).</p>

<p>All value types derive directly from System.ValueType and be sealed.
They can have instance and static fields and methods.
They can exist in two forms &#45; an unboxed form where they have value semantics and a boxed form where they become an object.
When calling an instance method on the unboxed form,
a managed pointer to it is passed.
When calling an instance method on the boxed form,
the reference is passed.</p>

<p>There is a special cases of value types,
System.Enum,
where there is only a single instance field that must be of an integral or number type.
These can be treated as integers or numbers on the stack as appropriate.
This allows the .NET platform to implement them efficiently (and will allow for the same to be achieved in the Parrot translation).</p>

<h2><a name="Parrot&#39;s_Support_For_Value_Types"
>Parrot&#39;s Support For Value Types <a href='#_top'><img alt='^' border=0 src='../../../../../resources/up.gif'></a></a></h2>

<p>While Parrot provides all the primitives upon which complex value types can be built,
it doesn&#39;t provide any support in the form that .NET does.</p>

<h2><a name="Translating_Value_Types"
>Translating Value Types <a href='#_top'><img alt='^' border=0 src='../../../../../resources/up.gif'></a></a></h2>

<h3><a name="Value_Types_Are_Really_Just_Classes_With_A_Property"
>Value Types Are Really Just Classes With A Property</a></h3>

<p>Value types have fields (in Parrot terminology,
attributes) and,
in their boxed form may have virtual methods called on them.
Their value semantics aside they are much like objects.
(The .NET benefit aside that you avoid an additional indirection; trying to emulate that in Parrot would be hard to do,
thus that is lost in this implementation of the translation.)</p>

<p>There needs to be a way to differentiate between the boxed and unboxed forms,
even though in the Parrot translation they are essentially the same thing at a data structure level.
Therefore,
a PMC property is used to mark an object as &#34;boxed&#34;.
This is optimized for the common case &#45; that the unboxed form will be being used.</p>

<h3><a name="Initialization"
>Initialization</a></h3>

<p>As it is completely OK to start using a value type without initialising it.
This is different from objects.
Locals that are to hold a value type therefore need to have their value type PMCs initialized.
For arguments this should be a non&#45;issue &#45; what gets passed will have been initialised.
For instance fields,
initialization should be done in the __init method.
For static fields,
initialization should be done at the point that static variables are declared.
For arrays,
each element needs to be initialized; this feels expensive and a possible improvement may be a special value type array PMC that,
if the element is empty,
auto&#45;vivifies it.</p>

<h3><a name="Copy_On_Load_(And_No,_I_Didn&#39;t_Mean_Write_;&#45;))"
>Copy On Load (And No,
I Didn&#39;t Mean Write ;&#45;))</a></h3>

<p>When a value type is loaded,
an instruction to clone it must be emitted directly afterwards.
These instructions include all loads from locals,
arguments,
array elements and fields.
These should all be marked up with the &#34;load&#34; instruction class and therefore this can be done automatically.
Note that care is needed with the interaction with LOADREG &#45; the pre_load and post_load without the &#34;need destination register&#34; flag should be allowed to proceed as normal,
then &#34;pre_op&#34; and &#34;post_op&#34; used to make the value available for the clone.
This way,
no additional assistance from the SRM is needed.
The SRM should not need to know about value types.
It doesn&#39;t want to.
I don&#39;t want to.
Your dog doesn&#39;t want to.
Nobody wants to.</p>

<p>Note that value types will also have to implement __clone.
This is because when a value type &#34;references&#34; another value type,
then it is really a flat data structure,
but in Parrot&#39;s view it&#39;s a reference to another PMC that will also need to be cloned.</p>

<h3><a name="Calling"
>Calling</a></h3>

<h3><a name="The_Enum_Special_Casae"
>The Enum Special Casae</a></h3>

<p>XXX TO DO</p>

<h3><a name="Box_and_Unbox_Instructions"
>Box and Unbox Instructions</a></h3>

<p>Both of these instructions need special cases for enumerations and the built&#45;in raw types.
For other value types,
a more general mechanism is required.</p>

<p>Boxing (through the box instruction) requires that the attributes are copied when the boxing takes place.
This can be done with the clone Parrot instruction,
and then the &#34;boxed&#34; property needs to be set.
The box instruction will update the stack type state so reflect that the object on the stack is now an object.</p>

<p>Unboxing does not require any copying of the attributes,
the operation simply needs to unset the boxed property and update the stack type state.
However,
the unbox instruction has an additional subtlety &#45; it places onto the stack not the unboxed value itself,
but rather a managed pointer to it.
This is not really a problem,
just some extra instructions to emit when translating the unbox operation.</p>

<h3><a name="Other_Value_Type_Instructions"
>Other Value Type Instructions</a></h3>

<h4><a name="initobj"
>initobj</a></h4>

<p>A PMC __init method can be provided; since it knows the fields it can be generated to do the Right Thing.
This instruction simply gets the value type using the managed pointer to it,
then calls its __init v&#45;table method.</p>

<h4><a name="copyobj"
>copyobj</a></h4>

<p>This is translated to a call to load_pmc on the managed pointer to get the value,
followed by a clone of that value and finally a call to store_pmc on the destination managed pointer.</p>

<h4><a name="ldobj"
>ldobj</a></h4>

<p>This is translated as a call to load_pmc on the managed pointer that is followed by a clone.</p>

<h4><a name="sizeof"
>sizeof</a></h4>

<p>XXX TO DO</p>

<p>Thoughts: as we are using PMCs then any array would be a PMC array so we can just hand back sizeof(void*)?
Or is that going to cause problems?
Ugh.</p>

<h4><a name="stobj"
>stobj</a></h4>

<p>Clone the PMC representing the value type,
then call store_pmc on the on the managed pointer to actually do the store.</p>
