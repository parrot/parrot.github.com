PDD SPRING CLEANING IN PROGRESS

The PDDs have gotten stale and dusty, and I think a family of cockatiels
has built a nest back behind pdd03.  So it's time for PDD spring cleaning!
(Yes, I know it's October, but cockatiels are from Australia.)

The first step is emptying out the room by moving all the current PDDs to
the "clip" directory.  That directory is for PDDs that have not yet been
put under the knife for review and modification or deletion.  As each
section of a clip PDD is discarded, renamed, edited, and/or retained, it
will be clipped out (thus the name) and inserted into a PDD in this
directory.  In the end, the clip directory will evaporate.

I'll be posting requests for help specific to the work of the moment
to p6i.  In the meantime, if you want to document how the current
Parrot works (i.e. fix pdd bugs), while I wouldn't embark on a rewrite
of any documents, it would be OK to add notes to the clip PDDs.  Think
of them as Wiki pages, but without the HTML.  (If you don't have a
commit bit, and you start submitting doc patches, somehow I think we'll
be able to find a commit bit for you.  :-))
