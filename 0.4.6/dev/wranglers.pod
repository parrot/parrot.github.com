=head1 NAME

docs/dev/wranglers.pod - Tips for Bug Wranglers

=head1 ABSTRACT

This document attempts to outline a set of "best practices" for dealing with
bugs in Parrot's RT system.  It is targeted at Parrot developers and "Bug
Wranglers" and is I<not> intended as advice or instruction for end users.  Bug
filing procedures for end users are documented in F<docs/submissions.pod>.

=head1 WHAT IS A BUG WRANGLER?

A developer with sufficient permissions to modify the tickets in Parrot's RT
system.  All Parrot developers are expect to pitch in and help keep the bug
tracker in a healthy state.  I<This means you!>

=head1 WHERE IS IT?

The Parrot bug tracker is currently the same as the I<Perlbug> system used for
Perl5 Development.  It is available via HTTP at L<http://rt.perl.org>.
The Parrot issues are in the queue I<parrot>.

=head1 BUG HANDLING PROCEDURES

=head2 New Bugs

Where I<New> refers to a pre-existing bug sitting in the Parrot queue with a
status of C<new>.

=over 4

=item * Is this spam?

Assign the issue to the queue I<spam>.

=item * Is this a duplication of an existing bug?

RT doesn't handle that case in a graceful manner. 
Set the relationship 'dependent on' to the duplicate issue. 
Add a comment to the bug along the lines of 
"Duplicate of Bug #123" and change the Tag field to "duplicate".

=item * Is there enough information?

Ask for more input.

=item * Is it a [TODO] bug?

Is the subject line in the format C<"[TODO] subsystem - issue>?

C<[TODO]> bugs should have their status changed to C<open> to prevent them from
appearing in a listing of C<new> bugs.

=item * Is it a [PATCH] bug?

Is the subject line in the format C<"[PATCH] subsystem - issue>?

Make sure that there is actually a patch attached to the bug...

=item * Assign the bug to someone if at all possible.

=back

=head2 TODO Bugs

=over 4

=item * Claim ownership or interest ( CC ) of the ticket.

This way you will receive further correspondence about the ticket.

=item * Run the test suite

=item * make manitest

=item * add the patch author to CREDITS or update the authors entry in CREDITS

=item * add correspondence to the bug stating that the patch was applied AND
the svn revision number.

=item * make sure that the bugs 'Tag' includes 'Patch'

=item * set the bugs 'Patch Status' to 'Applied'

=item * set the bugs 'Status' to 'resolved'

=back

=head2 Old Bugs

If the bug is more then I<1 month> old then it's considered an I<old> bug.

=over 4

=item * Ping the requestor

Give the requestor at least I<1 week> to respond.  If no response is received
then add a comment to the bug saying that the bug is being close because of no
response from the requestor change the status to C<rejected>.

If it's a [PATCH] bug it's possible that the patch was applied but the
bug/patch status was never changed.   Also, not all list traffic regarding a
bug ends up in RT.  It's best to look at the SVN repo to attempt to determine if
the bug was resolved.

=back

=head1 TIPS FOR CORRESPONDENCE

=head2 Don't be a Butthead

Remember that every word you type into the bug tracker is I<On The Record>.
Try not to say anything that could offend or hurt the feelings of I<anyone>.
That includes the bug submitter and other developers.  When, as a Parrot
developer with commit rights, you send correspondence you are representing the
Parrot project and by proxy TPF.  If in doubt, either send the message
privately or not at all.

=head2 Say thank you!

Try to add a little token of appreciation to every message you send in response
to a bug.  Bug requestors are doing labor for free!  The least you can do is
let them know that you appreciate their efforts.

Something like:

    Thanks,

    Thanks for following up.

    Thanks for reporting.

    Thanks for X!

Can work wonders.  If you can make someone feel good about themselves maybe
they'll submit another bug/patch/whatever or perhaps some day become a Parrot
developer.

=head2 Don't say "problem"

Supposedly it's better customer relations to use I<issue(s)> instead of the
I<problem(s)>.  Don't ask me why...

=head2 Make it clear why the bug status changed

Always note why the bug is having it's status changed.  Particularly if it is
being closed or rejected.  Nothing will irritate people more then letting them
think that their bug was unimportant or ignored.
