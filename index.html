    <!-- This is a simple redirection page.  Please note, I am using this url
    redirection because github pages looks for an 'index.html' in the main
    directory, but Parrot's 'index.html' page, along with all of the other
    autogenerated html pages, resides in the './html' directory, and, unless
    otherwise directed by a higher authority, I'm not going to hink 'round with
    the relative urls in the './html' directory.  Though, after everyone is
    certain this is the way we want to go, I might do something different, e.g.,
    patch the perl script to provide for the "new" relative urls. acy -->

    <!-- SECOND NOTE:  Alas, it appears certain "text mode WWW browsers with [a]
    ncurses interface," i.e., curses-oriented terminal browsers like 'links' and
   'lynx', do NOT auto-refresh, unless specificlly invoked with the correct
    option or properly configured (via a configuation file) to do so.  The
    consequence of which is, the user will see this redirection page and, then,
    have to invoke, directly, the redirected url, i.e., hit the "enter" key to
    go to the "proper" 'index.html' page. (I don't think there's a workaround
    for this, but, if there is, please, someone, let me know.  Thanks.) acy -->
