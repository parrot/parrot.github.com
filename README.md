## README - Readme for the conversion of 'docs.parrot.org' to github pages.

# DESCRIPTION

This README sets out the reason for the relocation of Parrot's documentation,
which ordinarily resides on 'docs.parrot.org', to [Github
pages](http://pages.github.com).  The basic idea is to make editing of the
documentation more readily accessible.  That is, with these pages now up on
github, folks can more easily fix or, alternatively, provide pull requests to
correct any errors in the documentation.

So, everyone, feel free to contribute!

# NOTE

As a rule, the Parrot team does not use the markdown format in Parrot's
repositories. We use pod. We have made an exception in this instance because
of a conflict between our 'README.pod' file and the contents of this readme,
and because github renders markdown before all other formats. This allows
us to display this page, rather than the contents of 'README.pod'.
