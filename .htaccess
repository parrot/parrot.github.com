<!-- This is a simple redirection file.  Please note, I am using this because
     github pages looks for an 'index.html', but Parrot's 'index.html' page,
     along with all of the other autogenerated html pages, resides in the
     './html' directory, and, unless otherwise directed by a higher authority,
     I'm not going to hink 'round with the relative urls in the './html'
     directory.  Though, if everyone is certain this is what we want to do, then
     I may do something different, e.g., patch the perl script to provide for
     the "new" relative urls. acy --> 

<!-- SECOND NOTE:  Alas, it appears certain "text mode WWW browsers with [a]
     ncurses interface," i.e., curses-oriented terminal browsers like 'links'
     and 'lynx', do NOT auto-refresh, unless specifically invoked with the
     correct option or properly configured (via a configuration file) to do so.
     The consequence of which is, the user will see this redirection page and,
     then, have to invoke, directly, the redirected url, i.e., hit the "enter"
     key to go to the "proper" 'index.html' page. (I don't think there's a
     workaround for this, but, if there is, please, someone, let me know.
     Thanks.) acy -->
